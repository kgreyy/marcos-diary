DIARY<br>
     On board 777 THE PRESIDENT at 9:00 PM I am about to take dinner in the dining saloon in this 2,400-ton Presidential yacht which is a carry over from the administration of President Garcia from 1957 to 1961. It was ordered reparations at an alleged cost of five million pesos. If ordered today it will probably cost double the amount. It is the length of a destroyer and originally intended for 18 knots but it is travelling only at 15 knots, never dry-docked or serviced during the time of President Diosdado Macapagal. It had to be repaired by its original manufacturers in Japan in 1966 so that it might continue to be in operation otherwise it would have been sold for scrap iron — such a pity since it is such a beautiful ship. In twenty minutes it will be turning to the point at Surigao street as we have just come from Tandag, Surigao del Sur.<br>
I <s>we</s> woke up at 4:30 o’clock in the morning of July 4th to discover we were anchoring between two islands that guarded entry into Tandag port. The passage from Tandag on the Pacific left side was rather rough some of bottles in the bar room either fell from the tables or or broken.<br>
I returned to the ship at 3:30 o’clock in the afternoon and I went to sleep at around 4:00 p.m. It was marred by noise in the Pacific side which somehow affected my golf which I attempted to exercise at about 5:30 p.m. I went around on the face on the deck for one-half hour and practiced petty ball net for another half hour after which my usual shower and massage while I worked on some papers and documents.<br>
We have been away from Manila since the 29th of June and we departed from Pier 5 at 11:30 AM to arrive at San Juanico street at 11:30 following morning and off Tacloban at 1:30 p.m.We anchored at the port to wait for the fluvial parade which started at 4:00 o’clock p.m. and which we participated. This fluvial parade is for the Santo Niño of Tacloban. I have been Hermano Mayor for this year and I was transferring the Santo Niño to Tacloban to the new Hermano Mayor, Secretary Eduardo Romualdez of Finance, cousin of Imelda. In the evening I dedicated a new song “IMELDA” in Tacloban, the music of which was composed by Mike Velarde and sang by Ric Manrique, Rita Rivera and Cely Bautista. At 11:30 in the evening we took the 777 THE PRESIDENT for Maasin, Leyte del Sur after the dedication of the song. We left Olot where the 777 was anchored for Maasin where we arrived at 6:30 following morning, July 1st, where I was supposed to participate in the Ninth Anniversary of the creation of the Province of Leyte del Sur. Imelda was to take a small plane for the airport at Hilongos and take one of the LOT US small helicopter for Maasin which was one hourdrive by car away. Instead however she took the DBP jet helicopter from Olot directly to Maasin which she made in 40 minutes to arrive 10:00 o’clock in the morning just after I had finished inspecting different projects like cementing of the roads, capitol building, school houses and was ready to start the program after the parade at the grandstand of Maasin High School referred to as Pilot High School in as much as it is the pilot project for high school and manpower training in the province. This was obviously the first helicopter that ever landed in<br>
Maasin and it attracted attention so much so it endangered the lives of the spectators who milled around the small helicopter. I ordered the two helicopters based at Hilongos at LCT to come to Maasin to seek cover. The reason I am taking the boat is first my nose is clogged and the doctors advised me **“**Do not fly while I have severe cold because any sudden changes in elevation may cause a rupture in eardrum or a return of my congestion of the inner ear and at the same time Imelda dreamt of accident in airplane because of the death of President Magsaysay at Mount Manungal on March 17, 1967. Because of the raw reports lately to the effect that the men of the Opposition candidate, Senator Sergio Osmeña, Jr., are planning a sabotage and they are after to assassinate me, she insisted that I do not take plane or helicopter any time now. And there have been on several instances of suspected sabotage of the Presidential plane – Fokker 29 – and the Presidential helicopter which crushed off Bohol made and crush landing in the water in Bohol and sunk after 40 minutes. After turning the point at Surigao del Norte and passing by the Mindanao deep at Dapa the seas have become even and quiet and the boat was quite stable. I find my visit to the provinces by ship more restive as there are none of these hurry and scurry which attend by plane.<br>
I also have an opportunity to rest in the afternoon after the meetings. When I went to Maasin on the first of July and after we finished the meeting Imelda flew by helicopter back to Olot, Leyte which she reached in 45 minutes. The five minutes delay of her arrival was apparently caused by her flying all over the various valleys throughout Leyte to acquaint herself with the agricultural areas of the Province. This is the first time she flew southward along the Pacific area by helicopter. I attended the lunch at the Governor’s house (Gov. Yñiguez) where I conferred with former Governor Bantug, Governor Bernardo Torres and the three LP mayors – Mayor Espina of Malitbog and the Lim brothers. At 2:30 p.m. we left Maasin and reached Olot at 9:30 in the evening. I was able to reach the guest house after a separate passage which is around 800 meters away off from the shore. The waves were quite probably about two feet high.<br>
But on the way from Maasin I went to sleep taking a short nap from 3 to 4 p.m. and to work on some papers and read some books.<br>
Same thing is true from Tandag. I was able to finish the conference at the Municipal hall at Tandag at about 2 o’clock p.m. I brought Congressman Gregorio Murillo and Congressman Constantino Navarro with Governor Modesto Castillo and Governor Sering of Surigao del Norte on board with me with some of the mayors, board members and councilors. We were finding solution for the organization of the party and the operations that we are conducting for registration of voters, and information on agricultural development. Agricultural development because we discovered in Surigao del Sur that up to now it has no irrigation system.<br>
I observed on the way to Tago, especially the way to the inauguration, of the road which we have opened a stretch of about 80 kilometers from Tandag to Leñgig, the road now having reached the last barrio of Surigao del Sur at San Roque and ready to reach Cateel of Davao at the cost of P2,600,000. For the first time the Bayabas-Kaguit and another town of South Agusan which was used to be unconnected with road are now connected by road. We are trying to finish the bridge at Gamot, Tago – the biggest voting town with the previous registered voters of more than 8,000. Tandag, the capital town, is about 5,000 only.<br>
We are also finishing a 4,000 hectares guaranteed irrigation project in Cantilan in the coast. It should be inaugurated before my birthday on Sept. 11.<br>
Four years ago in 19&amp;5 at about this time I have already finished campaigning throughout the entire Philippines but I remember that in the birthday of Imelda she had a small party going to Olot and I landed like Magellan from a small motor launch which could be brought within a meter of sandy beach and from which I jumped into beach itself. As soon as I became President I recommended to Congress in my State of the Nation address on January 23, 1966 to limit election expenditures and period for campaigning. I recommended the period for campaigning for national offices be limited to 120 days and for local offices be limited to 90 days.<br>
This was adopted and which is known as the Tañada-Singson law, because they were the ones who authored the bill I presented to both Houses of Congress. Because of this nominations to national offices such as the Presidency, Vice-Presidency and Senators have been delayed. On June 15, 1969 the Opposition or the Liberal Party, after much confusion and a costly consensus as well as a directorate meeting, all presumably financed by the candidates for the Presidency, the presidential nomination in the Opposition listed the officially nominated candidates; Senator Sergio Osmeña, Jr., Senate Minority Floor Leader Ambrocio Padilla and former Speaker Cornelio Villareal whom I have helped to depose in March 1967 because of the need for a fully controlled House of representatives in as much as the members of the Senate even in my own party were beginning to show antagonism towards my proposals who wore too revolutionary for their conservative taste. In his place I used my moral influence over the House of Representatives to support now incumbent Speaker Jose B. Laurel, Jr. I often wonder as to what would have been happening if this was not materialized because as of now I occasionally received reports from the Laurel family including one lady, senator whom we have helped to elect from our funds and actively campaigned in 1967 elections.<br>
Senator Salvador“Doy” Laurel has an ambition someday.I gathered information he is preparing for 1973 Presidential elections to coincide with the termination of the Laurel-Langley agreement. Either Speaker Laurel or Senator Salvador Laurel is aspiring for the Presidency. Our experience with a lady senator have been rather sad. Imelda personally chose Senator Helen Benitez, President of the Philippine Women’s University, her Alma Mater, as the lone representative of the ladies for senator in that election. We practically ran the nominations through the directorate meeting against the violent opposition of the old party leaders. She was specially mentioned by me in all my speeches in the campaign of 1967. She was given P200,000 for her personal expenses by the First Lady and yet a few days ago as Committee Chairman, in the Senate Committee on Housing, Urban Development and Resettlement, allegedly according to the papers for I have not received a formal report on this matter, she used uncalled for remarks attributed to me that we have violated the law and that the 16 million-dollar contract of machinery between National Housing Corporation and the Hildebrand for low cost housing was a waste of funds because an American Corporation presumably headed by Lock had testified that he could have produced 1/32 of the cost. As J. V. Cruz said in his column – HERE AND THERE – in the Manila Times, this naive assumption by the Committee which adopted this testimony of this American firm is not totally without any reservation nor any concern about the truth and basis of his statement has questioned the integrity of such men like Chairman, Board of Directors of the Development Bank of the Philippines and most prestigious bank, the President of the Philippine National Bank, the Administrator of the Social Security System and the General Manager and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Government Service Insurance System who were organizers of the National Housing Corporation which purchased this equipment.<br>
This is in accordance with my plan to set up a massive low cost housing construction program over the Philippines. This is because according to the experts we need to build 400,000 units every year to meet the requirements of housing shortage in the Philippines, 300,000 of which will be constructed in the urban areas and 100,000 units for mostly hard hit typhoon and fire victims and squatters and low income in the labor group.<br>
It was my intention to build houses for the laboring class costing not more than P5,000.00 each with two bedrooms and all the necessary facilities including kitchen, bathroom and toilet and small sala and dining room. No down payment whatsoever payable for a period of 20 to 25 years at a low rate of 6%. The amortization will probably be P1.00 a day. This could be afforded by our laborers residing in the urban areas. We are now hoping that the low-salaried earners will save in the form of rental at an average of P2.50 a day. Thus we have to purchase the equipment necessary to meet the needs for this massive housing. The conflict here arises the boldness such program was initialed for the capital outlay is indeed staggering initially since it is about 16 million pesos but perhaps over a period of _____ years the down payment of 16 million pesos which has already been paid in the form of funds of the national government by some financial institutions which made a complete study of the project from the view point of experts whom they have consulted. We havemet this problem with the effort to cut red tape in the purchase of equipment. But the Panel-Lock homes succeeded in getting some __________ of a judge issuing injunction. Incidentally one of these judges who has been rude before the Supreme Court as having been guilty of issuing injunction even without a hearing was suspended by me and later on removed from the judiciary, another bold step that we have to take which is unthought of in this society for which respect for the judiciary was at its highest type. We have to maintain the judiciary although grievances of people reaching the point of litigation will be probably redressed.<br>
For after the usual formality and the losing parties have obtained the services of our politicians in the legislature to bring about a legislative investigation to block the project. This was purely the obvious reason for the opposition by the second contractor who claims that they will be deprived of legitimate source of income by the government. When they were called by Chairman Licaros of the DBP and offered the contract to them to build the houses at the same rates and under the same rates confessed that they could not build those houses and yet the zarzuela continues their connection. It was made by no less than the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Housing and Resettlement, Senator Helen Benitez, who owes her position to the First Lady and myself. Perhaps it is necessary to record that recently she lost out in a conflict of boundary in a forest concession in Polilio, Province of Quezon to the Universal Timber Corporation. Before that she had been persisting in demanding the establishment of a sawmill presumably near her farm which I discover from the charges filed by incumbent minority floor leader of the House, Congressman Justiniano Montano, on the road to which she has spent part of the P200,000 that I released for typhoon damage from her provincial allocation. She has sought to obtain some deals in reparations which I refused to participate in and before the war damage educational fund was allocated among the private universities she wanted monopolize the amounts set for private institutions in medical center in the Philippine Women’s University all of which I turned down. I wonder what affected her change of position in the Senate.<br>
We are now proceeding towards Cagayan de Oro City which should be reached by five o’clock following morning. We may be able to proceed from here to Malaybalay, Bukidnon which I have not visited for sometime since I became President. Incidentally Cagayan de Oro City is within the Province of Misamis Oriental, the home province of Senator Emmanuel Pelaez, former Vice-President of President Diosdado Macapagal. He was my principal opponent in the convention of November, for Presidential nomination in the Nacionalista Party. I campaigned for my nomination from the date I joined the Nacionalista Party in April, 1964 up to the convention time, except the period when I was ill from an infection of the gall bladder in me for about one month. I was told by my doctors it was necessary to be operated on and the alternative was antibiotics but the second attack should probably be dextrose if I were not operated immediately. Imelda said I should not be operated as this would adversely affect my nomination in the coming convention of 1964. This was a chance that had to be taken and had to limit my diet to almost no meat and oil whatsoever. I had the gall bladder removed in January, 1967 immediately after my State of the Nation Address on January 23, 1967 when I suffered pains and several attacks before the Joint Session of Congress. Dr. Sison, my attending physician, at the time thought that the campaign was……<br>
The Presidential yacht is No. 777, the number of votes, that made me win the convention of 1964 as against Senator Emmanuel Pelaez who received 444 votes, in the second balloting in the convention.<br>
Senator Pelaez campaigned for President Macapagal bitterly attacking me on any pretext and ground whatsoever to run for a seat in the House of Representatives in that election of 1965. In 1967 when noticed that he was beginning to come along to my point of view on any issues where he claims he thought I was right, he decided to re-join the Nacionalista Party and run for the Senate. Most of the party leaders objected to his candidacy for the Senate. We were however able to push his nomination and he came out No. 5 in the election.<br>

I start a daily written record of my second term in office as President. This will be kept in loose-leaf so that all kinds of materials may be attached to the binder. Thus the background should be a treatise on the elections of 1969. This will be composed of my critique as well as the commentaries on the technique of victory.<br>
New Year – Left Ising’s Party for VP Agnew and the Foreign Ministers at 11:00 PM so that we could welcome New Year with the children. They were trying out the Bocaue sparklers at the garden and fountain in front of the main gate. Hope we did not break Ising’s party as VP and Mrs. Agnew followed us home and he tried a few sparklers himself before he went to bed.<br>
Mass at 12:40 – Sleep at 1:30 AM. Woke up at 7:00; back to bed to wake up and talk to VP and Mrs. Agnew up to 9:00 AM.<br>
Yesterday I finally transferred all of my worldly possessions to the Filipino people through the Ferdinand E. Marcos Foundation. I have been planning this for many years but I felt that the beginning of my second term was the most propitious time. This was a decision arrived at after a long deliberation and was not the result of pique, anger, despair or emotion – Nor is it due to a sense of guilt because some the funds come from the Yamashita treasure – Nor is it just a political stunt. I have no further political plans.<br>
And it seems a burden has been lifted from my shoulders.<br>
The surprising thing is that the reaction of the people seem to be of no consequence to me. It was a noble act waiting to be done. I feel I am above all the pettiness of men and I look down on them with some contempt but with a counterbalance of understanding.<br>
<strong>(ATTACHMENT)</strong><br>
<strong>STATEMENT OF PRESIDENT FERDINAND MARCOS ON DISPOSITION OF HIS WORLDY GOODS THROUGH THE MARCOS FOUNDATION</strong><br>
<strong>DECEMBER 31, 1969</strong><br>
DECEMBER 31, 1969<br>
DRAFT<br>
I have today given away by general instrument of transfer all my worldly possessions to the Filipino people through a foundation to be organized known as the Marcos Foundation.<br>
Moved by the strongest desire and the purest will to set the example of self-denial and self-sacrifice for all our people, I have today decided to give away all my worldly possessions so that they may serve the greater needs of the greater number of our people.<br>
It is my wish that these properties will be used in advancing education, science, technology and the arts.<br>
This act I undertake of my own free will, knowing that my need of material possessions will, having always been a simple man, my needs will always be lesser that those of many of our people, who have given me the highest honor within their gift, an honor unshared by any one of my predecessors and not likely to be shared by any one else in the future no other Filipino leader.<br>
Since about a year ago, I have asked my closest some of very my closest confidants to study the mechanics of this decision. Today studies have been completed, and a foundation will be formed to administer these properties and all funds that may be generated therefrom.<br>
My wife, Imelda, is in agreement with this decision. Provisions will be made for my children, so that they shall be assured of satisfactory education and be prepared to meet their lifetime duties and endeavors.<br>
For the moment, my most sincere hope is that this humble act shall set the example and move to greater deeds of unselfishness and compassion, many of our countrymen whose position in society gives them a stronger duty to minister to the needs of our less fortunate brothers and countrymen.<br>

Mrs. Agnew left this morning to join VP Agnew at Taipeh. Meldy had breakfast with her – 7:30 – she was not awake so she (Meldy) waited for 8:30 AM.<br>
Last Dec. 29, 1969 when I was playing golf two sausage twin-rotor navy (U.S.) helicopters for VP Agnew landed at the golf course and obstructed the whole fairway. When we asked that they move a little to the side so we could play through they did not bother but said we could go right ahead and hit the helicopters with our balls. Typical younger generation comment on this was Imee’s “Yabang na manga Cano –”.<br>
Ordered protection for the nine teachers of Batanes testifying about terrorism, a public hearing on the Nawasa rates hike, Com. Vera (BIR) to study a year’s amnesty for untaxed incomes voluntarily disclosed. In Ising’s party I asked Charlie Ledesma, President of the Sugar Planters to bring the planters to the palace on the 14th so I could convince them to pay the sacadas the minimum wage. Also ordered Gen. Yan to implement my original order to retrain the special forces and use them in Central Luzon as a unit.<br>
The children and Meldy had a crying bee on their not attending the Ising party (after lunch) at the dining table ending in our bedroom where we had a frank grievance session, by the way –<br>
Ka Erding’s Party at 8:30 PM after golf with Amante Begoriva and Amang Sabak. The announcement of the<br>
Iglesia support had certainly helped turn the tide but there are doubts as to whether they actually helped at the last minute or just kept neutral. They actually were a sly and cunning lot.<br>

Some people asked me why I have given away my earthly possessions. I invariably answered that I did not need them but that the people did.<br>
But I have been asking myself why has the world become so vile, so materialistic, so dirty. All is pragmatism, selfish and unedifying.  Why is there no more tenderness – all sex? Why is there no more charity – all malice? Even the clergy has become self-centered. They do not sacrifice for sacrifice’ sake, but for self-glorification like the seven bishops who had their appeal to me published in the front pages of the metropolitan dailies. If their motivation was sincere change, they could have come to me first – but they sought publicity first. The worst part is their premises were all false, I hope, from ignorance not malice.<br>
During the war in some critical phase of a battle I always asked myself what could I do which others dare not do and which would change the tide of battle.<br>
Now after the 1965 elections I kept asking myself this – until I decided that giving my properties to the people was the answer.<br>
This would be exemplary. No one else dares to do it.<br>
It will change the tide of the times.<br>
Instead of pragmatism – compassion.<br>
Instead of words – deeds.<br>
Instead of self – the nation &amp; humanity.<br>
And I gather this has been the effect in the capitals of the world.<br>
Satisfying but I must exert effort so I am not myself dragged into self-glorification. I remember after the war I concealed everything about my medals. I wish I could do a similar anonymity now.<br>
Finalizing the foundation papers. Accounting more difficult than I thought.<br>
Princess Tarhata Kiram and her husband gave me a memo tonight on their alleged mistreatment by the Phil. Govt. and their wish to deal directly and not thru the Phil. Govt. – as always they also asked for pocket money.<br>
Birthday party in San Juan (Ortega) of Alita Romualdez Martel who is now _______? The Romualdezes who are all on the substantial side all had an electrocardiograph. Poor Dits had a tough time.<br>
Boni Serrano just died from a heart attack. Have to go and see his body in Camp Crame chapel tomorrow.<br>
Had Dr. Chamberlain to check me – all well. My blood pressure after golf – 112/80.  7:00 PM Dr. Chamberlain has been called to attend to Iñing Lopez comatose in a hotel lobby in Tokyo &amp; again in Manila from bypoglycomia (no sugar in the blood). Bad Luck!! He is recovering.<br>
Tomorrow, the politburo prisoners are released. Have ordered that they be placed under surveillance. The Peking-trained kids have organized a New People’s Army in Tarlac under Arthur Garcia.<br>
Am collecting the reactions to my disposal of all my possessions to the people.<br>
Some are sanctimonious, supercilious, patronizing (Imee loves to repeat these newly discovered words) frauds.<br>
I fear for our country. There is not one among the younger generation whom we can build up as President. Among the Nacionalistas, Puyat and Lopez are too old, Tolentino has a background of promiscuity, Diokno is self-centered and lacks humility. Among the Liberals Roxas is a weakling, Aquino is a congenital liar, a braggart and a compulsive chatterbox, Magsaysay is brainless, Salonga is petty, pompous, sanctimonious fraud.<br>

Ex-Pres. Macapagal who is visiting in Singapore says that he is shocked by the news that there is supposed to be a secret agreement for the Sabah claim to be relinquished by the Philippines after the resumption of diplomatic relations.<br>
There is no such agreement. I used Mr. Moon Park and Mr. Chang Ming Thieu as emissaries to Prime Minister Tungku Abdul Rahman and Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Ragak so that they would agree to the resumption of diplomatic relations. The Tungku had insisted on such relinquishment of the claim and a recognition formally of the sovereignty of Malaysia over Sabah, but I refused and they formally agreed that after diplomatic relations our two peoples should get used to each other travelling in our respective countries before we spoke of these matters. The Filipinos should now go to Sabah and invest there.<br>
VP Agnew in Thailand and Taipeh has said that I asked him whether America was slowly withdrawing from Asia and he had answered in the negative. I asked Pres. Nixon the same thing. He was more vague, although when he reached the U.S. he did say what Agnew is saying now.<br>
What I want to know is what bases they are going to keep in Asia and what troops where, and under what arrangements<br>
Agnew is quoted as saying he had told me that he had made me understand and that he told me that, of course, the number and location would change with the need.<br>
He told me nothing of the kind.<br>
On the last day of his stay here, Jan. 1st, when I talked to him about the U.S. helping us on our present balance of payments problem, he was evasive. I did not press the point.<br>
Either he has no power to commit the U.S. or he is still feeling his way around.<br>
During the conference at 11:30 AM if Dec. 31st when I met all the special envoys of 44 governments who attended my inauguration, the only matter on which there was some vestige of promise of help was on studies of typhoons and their control. Amb. Byroade is supposed to follow this up.<br>
I impressed on VP Agnew that we in Asia could not make any plans on our security if we did not know their plans but that however even in such state of ignorance we in the Philippines are moving to prepare to defend ourselves on our own.<br>
He invited me to come to the U.S. after September 1970 – preferably not while the other heads of state are in the U.S. on the UN anniversary. I made no commitment on the exact date but did promise to go.<br>
Pres. Nixon and VP Agnew strike me as very evasive about helping the Philippines now although they are supporting us in the IMF and IBRD in our efforts to get dollar loans.<br>
I am skeptical about the wisdom of a trip to the U.S.<br>
I have told Sec. Romulo repeatedly that there should be no further talks of the U.S. military bases in the Phil and our wish to remove them as we will use this as the “ultimate weapon” in the trading that may be needed to obtain recognition of our special preferences in the American market. For if our quota on sugar is not extended by the Sugar Act’s extension this year or by treaty in the replacement of the Laurel-Langley agreement, then the sugar industry is wrecked and our economy may be disastrously affected.<br>
So I have told VP Agnew that before the formal negotiations on trade and security start we should have an understanding as to what terms such negotiations would arrive at. I said that I would like Amb. Byroade to be able to sit down with me on this.<br>
Rod Reyes, editor of the <em>Manila Chronicle</em>, has just told Kits Tatad that they are planning to serialize the libelous book of Chit Navarro on Imelda.<br>
We have to watch the Lopezes and Montelibano. They are still sore for my veto of their franchise to operate a telephone and telecommunications company anywhere in the Philippines and the NuVue – a cable television company that would select programs from any of the television companies (without permission from the latter) to be flashed to their subscribers by cable. Both were illegal and unconstitutional but they took offense at the veto.<br>
They are the worst oligarchs in the country.<br>
I must stop them from using the government for their own purposes.<br>
Piding Montelibano is working on the reclamation project of Republic Real Estate – pending adjudication in the courts.<br>
Iñing Lopez strongly urged that I appoint Piding as Secretary of Finance, as if the position were vacant. This was a repetition of the recommendation in 1965.<br>
Peace and order must be immediately attended to.<br>
I must work out the programs for exports and tourism.<br>
Then I must appoint the replacement of Gov. Calalang as Governor of the Central Bank. The IMF consultative group arrives in Jan. 10th.<br>
There are more than 100 CFI vacancies, 7 Court of Appeals, one in the Supreme Court and another vacancy coming up in February.<br>
The Armed Forces has too many hold-overs who should be retired.<br>
We must change the strategy in Central Luzon against the Huks. We must restudy the use of civilians either as agents or informers.<br>
There are three basic problems that I am personally attending to:</p>
<ol>

Monching Durano, Uging Navarro, Floring Crisologo, Ali Dimpaporo and Joe Alberto came to see me as they want to change Laurel as speaker of the House. He has been criticizing me again and so has his brother, Doy Laurel who wants to run for President in 1973.<br>
I have given permission for them and their groups which would be controlling, not to attend the caucuses called by Speaker Laurel.<br>
However, we would have more problems if Laurel is deposed as speaker. But we will keep him after we have clarified the position they (he and his Capo) have taken on the apparently socialist and communist policies they are pronouncing under the guise of nationalism and the unjustified criticisms of his brother.<br>

Breakfast with Speaker Laurel, Speaker Pro Temp Jose Aldeguer and Maj. Floor Leader Marcelino Veloso. Told him of the drift towards the left and the fear of political leaders, businessmen and the military that we are not taking steps to prevent it but are instead encouraging it. He has agreed to remove Emmanuel Yap, head of Cepo and his next in rank Lichauco.<br>
Then met with Former Speaker Villareal and Com on Appro Chairman Jose Alberto who agreed that we call a Nacionalista House Members Caucus Tuesday, Jan. 13th 10:00 AM at Pangarap. I intend to interview the different blocs and see who is supported by the majority.<br>
But we must not allow the Nacionalista Party to split up on this rivalries. We must keep our old cohesion. So I also intend to call Pres. Pro Temp Jose Roy, rival of Pres Puyat for the Presidency of the Senate.<br>
A demonstration of Batanes students – about 500 asked for arrest of those still terrorizing would-be witnesses. They claim PC helpless. So I have ordered the NBI deputy chief, Ponciano Fernando to personally go with 12 PC men who are from Batanes, to obtain evidence against, identify, arrest and prosecute all the alleged terrorists. I challenged the young men and women to fight for their rights by testifying and convincing their relatives, friends and fellow Batanenses to testify.<br>
I am happy that my speech before the Rotary yesterday noon on Open Skies for one year and lifting of the suspension of loans for mining and new export oriented industries has been taken well.<br>
I can feel the confidence surging back to our people. Standard remark was: “We did not know this was being done. We are glad he is President.” Soft-soap but gratifying.<br>
Earl Mazo, Nixon’s biographer, has just interviewed me and he says Imelda and I are so high above the newspapers and the crowd now that we should not be concerned what the papers print because if it is bad, the people will not believe it anyway.<br>
Two questions have come up in his interview:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="213" data-line-end="214">Are the U.S. military bases in the Philippines a deterrent or a magnet to bombing and/or nuclear attack. (The Recto &amp; Laurel position is that they are mere magnets not deterrents and are not only useless but prejudicial to Philippine national interest.) I personally believe that now with the present nuclear capability of Red China and the ABM buildup of the U.S., we need the bases for the defense of the Phil. If China had not developed its nuclear capability we would not need them. Pres. Nixon explained to me last March when Imelda and I attended the Eisenhower memorial services in Washington D.C. how the U.S. would use the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) to counter-act any nuclear threat from Red China.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="214" data-line-end="216">What will happen to our economy, specially the sugar industry if the IS does not extend our special preferences. (Of course the sugar industry would collapse because special preferences or the quota given us in the American market allows us to sell our sugar at the favored price of 7 cents a pound as against 3 cents a pound in the world market. And our cost of production is from 3 to 4 cents a pound. Our dollar earnings from sugar alone is $160 million out of a total dollar earnings of $1.5 billion.)<br>

I have enclosed the study of the nullification of the congressional elections in Batanes so I can call a special election but the Comelec (Ferrer, Miraflor and Patajo) says they think there is a hiatus in the law and that their power to nullify is in grave doubt. So I have suggested that they pass a resolution that no one has been elected because in the five towns only in one (the capital of Basco) has there been peaceful and free elections. The Speaker of the House would then be compelled to certify to a vacancy in Batanes. Then I would call a special election.<br>
Have ordered that Commodore Cabal, the commander of the South West Command, and who is from Batanes, — go to Batanes with a squad of marines to give protection to the people there.<br>
The groups supporting Ex-Speaker Villareal for speakership have asked me to remain neutral in the speakership fight and will take this stand in the caucus next Tuesday. The reasons they (Yñiguez who has withdrawn at my promptings, Niling Espinosa, Joe Alberto, Floring Crisologo) give for opposing Laurel is that Banjo Laurel, mayor of Tanauan and son of the Speaker, has been withdrawing funds from the House, signed by Eucinas, chairman of the Committee on accounts and monopolizes all contracts of the House.<br>
Have ordered a tariff and tax free zone to be established in the Nayon Pilipino at MIA; the release of P2.2 million for the new finger terminal at MIA and the preparation of the runway for the Jumbo Jets. We need to add two inches on the surface. Conferred with Sec. Leo Virata, CAA Administrator Federico Ablan and MIA Airport Manager Luis Tabuena.<br>
Boni reports a new assassination plot by the same group masterminded by Terry Adevoso. Malacañang is under sector Noth Manila leadership of which was offered to Joe Maristela, former CIS head, now our informant.<br>
Everybody is suggesting that Imelda take over the efforts at improving tourism. 800,000 to one million tourists visit Hongkong yearly, 400,000 to Bangkok – but only 120,000 to Manila.<br>
So I have asked that all airlines, new and old, be allowed to land in the Philippines without limit at least for one year – the year of Expo-70. We should known then how this will affect our domestic airlines. My feeling is this will build up so much traffic that they will have their share of the increase.<br>
The Chief of Police of Angeles City (a Sumanlan) and a relative of Gov. Nepomuceno, more accurately Mrs. Nepomuceno (who is a Sumanlan) has just been killed. The PC surmise that a man of Mayor Suarez did it as Nepomuceno is feuding with Commander Sumulong, who is in partnership with Mayor Suarez. Nepomuceno is in turn in partnership with Commander Dante.<br>
So I will let them finish off each other in the meantime. But we have got to get in and finish all of them before they wreck the entire government.<br>
I feel, however, that the Barrio Home Defense force of 5 or ten men per barrio is the answer to the Huk movement.<br>

Our national security –<br>
Our principal problem is still internal subversion not foreign aggression. We are protected by the oceans from the latter. But more than this we are protected by the following set of circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="244" data-line-end="245">Red China’s present internal problems of development which occupies her energies, leaders and resources.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="245" data-line-end="246">The incipient quarrel between Red China and Russia.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="246" data-line-end="247">Japan’s present allergy to the suggestion to rearm.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="247" data-line-end="263">The presence of the U.S. in Asia.<br>
The first three circumstances may not be there after a decade. The only deterrent would be the presence of the U.S. through bases in South Korea, South Vietnam, Thailand, southern Japan and the Philippines. This was what Ambassador Byroade must have been referring to in his Rotary Speech last November after the elections.<br>
The ideal situation would be if the U.S. maintains its presence with its nuclear umbrella in Asia, without the indignity of American bases in the Philippines.<br>
In the meantime the American military bases, if they have to stay, must be governed by agreements that should be updated to the level of other countries’ treaties on the same subject – like that of Spain and Thailand.<br>
And now as in the years to come, the Philippines must watch the balance of power in Asia. If Red China has no counterpoise, it may find the time to establish its dream of Asian hegemony. The counterpoise could be Russia which is trying hard to become an Asian power, and Japan which will ultimately rearm.<br>
The ideal is Russia and Red China not settling their quarrel and Red China and Japan not being too friendly to each other.<br>
Whatever the international situation is, we must be prepared to defend our country alone. The classic defenses on the air, the sea and on the beaches must be augmented with the home defense concept of the guerilla which will make any attack (external or internal) of a massive nature too costly to be considered lightly by a potential aggressor.<br>
I must establish communications in the barrios covered by the Barrio Home Defense Force. Sitio San Juan, Barrio Moriones, Tarlac, Tarlac, was raided yesterday morning (after midnight) by possibly Huks out to terrorize the Barrio Home Defense Forces there which fought back for 20 minutes. If there had been an alarm system, helicopters could have brought succor.  Flashlight battery run and cheap and simple – buzzer coded system.<br>
One woman was killed and five men wounded.<br>
Two helicopters helped capture in Barrio Patling, Capas, Tarlac, Huk Commander Rody Dizon alias Rody and four companions. Dizon was still carrying the Armalite of S/St. Nestor M. Mariano of the 511 PC Ranger Company.  The name of Mariano was still on the butt of the Armalite.<br>
We will use the helicopters more and more. One should be based at II PC Zone HQ. and three at Basa Airfield on alert.<br>
According to the men in the field, the Huks are in dreadful fear of the helicopters.<br>
Everybody in the city speaks of the “monkees” when they were ordered disbanded a long time ago.<br>
On foreign exchange earnings, we can offer the products of our parks, forest resources and even the ores to be mined from our mineral reserves with govt. doing the work – provided the buyers now advance a few hundred million dollars. Am looking into this possibility.<br>
As well as selling our old coins and minting new ones – of gold.<br>

Worked the whole afternoon on counter-insurgency, the emergency plan and the Barrio Home Defense Force.<br>
A new confirmed report of a plot to assassinate both me and the Vice President has just been reported by Boni and confirmed by Joe Maristela. The military group is headed by Terry Adevoso – the political group is still being checked.<br>
Apparently the plans of the Liberal paralleled those of the communists. They will await the results of my efforts to improve the economic situation then if I fail, they will take advantage of this by assassination.<br>
Well, we must not fail!!<br>
And I must check the participation of Pres. Puyat of the Senate and Speaker Laurel of the House.<br>
Ralph Nubla reported tonight that Congressman Yap of Tarlac, right-hand man of Sen. Ninoy Aquino, has said that they will give me six months – then they will strike. We must clarify all these plans.<br>
Imelda has a mass in the right breast and worries us because the doctors say that while there has been no change, an operation to remove it and to find out if it is malignant may be necessary.<br>
I am suffering from pain in the right groin after golf. I hope it is not hernia. I see the doctor tomorrow.<br>
And we were on a project to have another baby, a boy if possible. Massive injections of hormones for Imelda is necessary if we are to have a baby and this is not good for her growth in the breast which might develop into something serious with these hormones.<br>

Have told the congressmen we should keep Laurel as speaker in the whole morning and afternoon caucus. All the members of the Junta were for Laurel after I told them I was. But the Junta and I, first, had to announce for the consumption of the public that we could not intervene in purely internal matters of the House, unless the House members themselves asked us to personally intervene.<br>
After this, I called a conference of Cong. Ramon Durano, Nicanor Yñiguez, Ali Dimaporo, Ugung Navarro, Joe Alberto, Maling Espinosa, and Floring Crisologo to tell them that inasmuch as they are the leaders of Ex-Speaker Villareal, it was their duty to inform him of my decision and that the most ideal situation would be for Villareal to withdraw. Then I asked Villareal and Laurel to come into the conference room and notified each in turn of my efforts to prevent an open fight.<br>
A committee of six, three from Laurel’s side (Maj. Floor Leader Veloso, Asst. Floor Leader Mercado and Chiongbian), then three on Villareal’s side (Yñiguez, Alberto and Ali Dimaporo) was organized to proposed amendments to the rules of the House.<br>
Because of the ramifications of the Adevoso plot, I must include Johnny Ponce Enrile in the counter-planning – and perhaps J-2, Col. Fidel Ramos and the NBI. Played golf at Pangarap with the Malacañang reporters. Pain in the groin has disappeared. The doctors, Dr. Yap and P. Marcos think it was just a muscle sprain.<br>

Manila is talking about the sugar bloc blackmailing me into supporting Laurel for Speaker with the editorials of the Chronicle, the resignation of Nolan, the expected resignation of Montelibano and other signs.<br>
What they do not know is that Iñing Lopez when I saw him on the 13th at the Meralco Hospital insisted on the appointment of Montelibano as Secretary of Finance on the ground that there was need for a new face in the Finance Dept. I am sure this is because Danding Romualdez has refused to be their tool. Anyway I told him that if Danding Romualdez should be changed this would be an admission of the failure of the monetary policies which I am not ready to do because I approved of them. Although the state of our balance of payments was never revealed to me until June 1969 when it was impossible to do anything as any retrenchment and curtailment of imports and government expenditure would have caused a skyrocketing of process during the political campaign. This would have been a disaster.<br>
But as soon as my reelection was assured, I ordered all the necessary steps to be taken like the curtailment of imports and the cutting of government expenditures; all public works releases have been suspended, all casuals terminated, loans and guarantees by the government financing institutions stopped. Prices went up and I had to call the retailers, dealers and importers to maintain the old level of prices. We sent a mission to the U.S. and Europe to obtain new loans and restructure our short-term loans.<br>
Ting Roxas bungled the mission. According to Iñing Lopez, Maurice, the President of the German National Bank, Ting Roxas panicked everybody in Germany into believing that the Philippines was in chaos. And they came to the Philippines to see for themselves. To their surprise they discover us still operating as a democracy.<br>
Curse upon these theoretical economists!<br>

Meldy’s cyst in the right breast has been removed and found benign –as the report says the mass is a fibrocystic disease.<br>
When Inday (Dr. Paciencia Dicena) brought out the specimen, I was shocked at the size. It was about three inches by eight inches and a quarter of an inch thick. Dr. Pantangco and Ferriol were the pathologist. Dr. Pacifico Yap assisted by Dr. Uy performed the operation. Dr. Quentin Gosieg was the anesthesiologist assisted by Inday. Present were the heart specialists, Dr. Juanita Zagala and Dr. Pedro Cruz.<br>
We slept at the hospital last night at about 11:30 and woke uo at 5:00 AM when she was injected with some sedatives. Operation started at about 615 frozen section after 15 minutes and finished (sutured) at about 7.00 PM. A little depression was left at the site but the opening was only about three inches long.<br>
Reinstated my appointments for the day and met with the different chambers of commerce who have a letter offering cooperation, the Provincial Press Federation, Bishop Gaviola and Mr. Watanabe, the President of the Asian Development Bank.<br>
The whole city is still talking about the supposed rift between the sugar bloc and me. Yesterday Bobby Benedicto wnt to see Peding Montelibano. Called me up by telephone and I talked to Peding who was ill with influenza and he promised to come and see me at the Palace on Monday.<br>
We were all agreed that the cyst of Meldy was benign as it had not changed in size for the last two years and in fact has actually reduced in size. But she was beginning to contaminate  everyone with her tension including me.<br>
Meldy is resting well and ate Chinese lugaw from Ralph tonight. Bongbong kept us in stitches with stories of his first dance and the children’s parties he has attended.<br>
Horrors, Mother says she will be 77 next month and feels like 20 after Dr.  Meliavo and Switzerland. What a lot of these people in this room would give to feel like 20, specially Zita Feliciano who is trying to peep into my diary.<br>
All these women around here, I bet are all wondering if they have lumps in their breasts.<br>
Yesterday there was a demonstration of students from the Central University, Phil. Normal School and Phil. College of Arts and Trades for the release of P65 million and the appointment of their own choice of President for the Central University.<br>
Tonight Ignacio Lacsina led a thousand demonstrators in what Gen. Raval says is a month-long demonstration against the administration and the various govt. agencies like the PC, against alleged partisanship of the PC for the Northern Motors in the strike there. Ordered an investigation.<br>
Ordered Gen. Raval to follow-up of the plan I directed to set up alarm systems in the barrios under the BHDF.<br>

Manila Times and even the Bulletin are trying to promote a fight between me and the Media. Manila Times headlined the Nolan resignation, actually editorializing in that story.<br>
Then, yesterday, the Bulletin carried the front page story of me keeping on with attacks on the press quoting my statement or speech read by VP Lopez in the Bureau of Plant Industry inauguration that “notwithstanding the critics, we have moved forward”. This was interpreted, I suppose, to mean that the press are critics or the only critics and should not be referred to with the slightest hint of derision.<br>
My relations with the press in general, with the exception of the Malacañang boys has soured since the inaugural speech.<br>
They can dish it out but cannot take it.<br>
My erstwhile opponent, Sen. Sergio Osmeña, has gone to see Pres. Soeharto of Indonesia, and as reported by Ambassador Farolan, is determined to get the dormant concession of Brigido Valencia at Sumatra or East Kalimantan belonging to Americans. Accompanied by a representative of Nissio-Nurai, apparently the financier, this party surveyed the Sumatra concession of Valencia and apparently a favorable report submitted.<br>
Osmeña bragging here, in Japan and the Philippines that he can buy any Indonesian official. Apparently the funds to be used by the Adevoso group on their assassination and take-over plans will come from Osmeña. Osmeña is also in touch with the groups that are preparing a revolution in Sabah and has been instrumental in the offer by Malaysia or Sabahan authorities in offering to Princess Tarhata and Sultan Ismail Kiram to buy out their claim to Sabah. They may sell only their private rights. But I have ordered Sec. Romulo to write a formal letter to Sultan Ismail Kiram that he has authorized the Philippine government to bargain for him and that he must not embarrass our government; and for Amb. Busuego to informally notify the Malaysian authorities that Sultan Kiram cannot bind the Philippine government.<br>
Deputy Premier Tun Abdul Razak of Malaysia has announced a record U.S.$ 267.7 million budget for defense and internal security or 25% of the total expenditure of U.S.$ 1,080,130,000 for FY 1970. Defense budget for FY 1969 is U.S.$ 132M or 9.2% of the total 1969 budget. Razak justified the increase with the British military withdrawal and the stepped-up communist terrorist activities.<br>
In Pakistan 56 million registered to vote out of 125 million in Pakistan’s first general elections scheduled 4 Oct 1970.<br>

The IMF consultative committee headed by Mr. Zavkar will recommend devaluation. We cannot accept this.<br>
Osmeña filed a protest against me in the Presidential Electoral Commission yesterday. This will give us a chance to reveal what the Liberals did in the last elections.<br>
Gov. Licaros of the Central Bank informs me that the IMF team is meeting them tomorrow at 10:00 AM. So the Fiscal Policy Committee will see me here at the hospital at 8:00 AM.<br>
Amb. Addis of the United Kingdom is coming to bid goodbye at 10:00 AM.<br>
The boys, Vincent Recto, Monching Cojuangco, Joe Campos, Danny Vasquez all report that there is still rampant smuggling and <em>tong</em> collection at the Customs and the BIR.<br>
We will have to revamp the two offices or change the tax collection system. I have already authorized tax collection by the banks of some taxes.<br>
An elite team of young idealists can check on the payment of taxes of all goods in stores.<br>
In the export office, the subordinate personnel are still collecting or extorting money from exporters. We must stop this by catching some of them in the act.<br>
The Manila Times has become completely vicious. There are three false stories in its front page today: the headline of an alleged arms smuggling syndicate, including a northern congressman and a Chinese millionaire, the alleged offer by me to Villareal of the Secretaryship of Defense to placate him on the speakership fight, and the alleged resignation en masse of the Phil. Sugar Institute because of my designating Floro Cruz.<br>
So has Europa of the Evening News – the ungrateful cad. When he needed a job, he came begging. Now he is mean and carping.<br>
So are almost all the columnists.<br>
I intend to ignore these developments as usual and will turn to Television more and more.<br>
So I intend to order a bulletin fortnightly where we can express our government position and a weekly or biweekly telecast by Bob Garcia on the same. We must keep a well-integrated indexed file of all government positions.<br>
I will go to television with the Talkathon format on the eve of elections answering questions from the public in the audience or sent in by telephone.<br>

Imelda is strong enough to play host to her crowd nightly. We have just eaten Chinese lugao and lumpia brought in by Joe and Betty Campos. I liked most the <em>bajo</em> or powdered beef <em>tapa</em> and the seeweed for the lumpia. It is now 11:00 PM. Last night we went to bed at 11:30 PM. Read De Gaulle’s war memoirs up to 1:30 P.M. after writing my diary.<br>
I must soon write my war memoirs while the events are still fresh in my mind.<br>
Met with the fiscal policy committee at 8:00 AM here in the hospital and gave instructions to Com. Sychangco and Gov. Licaros to reconcile the figures on government deficits. The Central Bank has the figures at P1.1 billion cash deficit. Com. Sychangco says the cash deficit is only P600 million with savings of P283 million.<br>
I have also ordered Gov. Licaros to put down in a formal Aide Memoire to be handed to the IMF consultative committee our position that we will not agree to a devaluation and will take any measures short of it; — and to include the stabilization measures we have adopted including the allowance of the establishment of dollar accounts in Philippine banks with 100% dollar backing and to allow hotels to keep 25% of their dollar earnings because right now the dollar earnings of hotels has gone down to zero.<br>
I met with Piding Montelibano, who was brought to Pangarap by Bobby Benedicto. He has just recovered from the flu which is all over Europe and Asia.<br>
[<em>Marginal note</em>: We must now develop rural electrification under the new law passed last year and Schools of Arts and Trades. The British Ambassador who came to say goodbye also seems to agree these will bring about development faster.]<br>
Incidentally Col. Ver reports to me that Terry Adevoso, the mastermind of the assassination and military takeover of the government informed the conferees of the Junta in their meeting at the house of Commodore Alcaraz that the Vice President or the Lopez group has its own liquidation plot for me. I must look into this more deeply.<br>
I intend to have the EEA cases filed against Adevoso and Emmanuel Ocampo his operations man to keep them occupied. But at the same time we must obtain evidence for the filing of a case of conspiracy to commit treason. Apparently included in the plot is Col. Patterson, the U.S. Embassy military attaché, or so Adevoso says. Terry Adevoso said that he spoke to Ambassador Byroade about their plot and while the Ambassador was defending me he said that if he (Adevoso) had anything to ask or tell him, he (Adevoso) should talk to Patterson. Adevoso said that it was Patterson who suggested that Ayala and Nagtahan Bridges should be blown up so as to isolate Malacañang Palace during the attack.<br>
Included in the plot are Alcaraz, David Pelayo, Capt. Acosta of the Navy.<br>
Their target date is June or July this year.<br>

I still write this in Veterans Memorial Hosp. at 8:00 AM. Meldy is coming home to the Palace at noon before lunch.<br>
We have stopped the regular stipends to the columnists and newspapermen. This was started by Pres. Magsaysay in 1954. But we have to stop this corruption. This may be the cause of the harsh and even vicious attitude of the newspapers.<br>
I am still trying to ferret out the TV and radio commentators who are being bought. This has to be stopped too. The Commissioner of Civil Service, Abelardo Subido, has been found guilty in the investigation of his actuations in entering into contracts with himself. I have requested him to resign.<br>
We have to set the example in the higher echelons of government. For undoubtedly there is still petty graft in the lower ranks – the export office is one, the BIR and the Customs. This must be eradicated and soon.<br>

Settled the Speakership problem this morning by calling Ex Speaker Villareal, then Speaker Laurel to Maharlika. Villareal graciously withdrew but his supporters swear that if Laurel does not remain loyal to me, they will topple him.<br>
Met the congressmen who all wanted releases and appointments.<br>
Met Commissioner of Civil Service Abelardo Subido whom I asked to resign for violation of the Anti-Graft Law for signing a contract of lease both as lessor and lessee.<br>
Will reorganize the army so that the IInd and IIIrd Military areas will be converted into brigades. More flexible and fitted to the concept of home defense or guerrilla war. Updating the emergency plan to include not only counter-insurgency but even a military attempt at a take over. Have ordered Gen. Raval to prepare a strike force in Camp Crame. Must get the armored units, the air force and naval units organized.<br>
Met Sec. Mata, Usec. Melchor, Gen. Yan, Ileto, Raval, Singson and Com. Lomibao.<br>
Will meet with Gov. Licaros and Zavkar of the IMF tomorrow. Looks like Zavkar has no power to negotiate but has been instructed to propose devaluation of from 25% to 30% or a multiple rate of exchange. From reports, Zavhkar is of the belief that we will not be able to enforce a multiple rate of exchange. They want a budget surplus in the next six months – which we already have.<br>
The truth of the matter is everything – but everything is awaiting at a standstill the results of the consultations with IMF – both government and the private sector cannot move until we know what the BOP strategy is.<br>

Have met (at 11:00 AM up to lunch and 1:30 PM) with Dr. Zavhkar of the IMF and Gov. Licaros and have convinced him that instead of a 25% devaluation a floating rate would be better to be set about the later part of February. But 75% of the export earning of the traditional exports of sugar, coconut, lumber, minerals etc should be sold to the Central Bank at P3.90 per dollar and the remaining 25% goes to the exporter and can be sold at the floating rate, so as to attend to his requirements. Then we can lift the import budget but we would have to keep credit restraints for the next six months. The Central Bank will earn $600 million which can be used by the public sector only after six months. We can now lift guarantees at a certain level provided they are at least for five years – specially for export oriented industries. We still must restrain travel, public spending and luxury imports. We must raise P600 million by new taxes. The strongest argument that apparently convinced him was the violence that might attend devaluation; the demand for increase of wages and salaries.<br>
He is correct though that if we merely engaged in restrictions, the economy would be stagnant while the prices would go up anyway because of the reduction in production and imports. Then there would also be mass lay-offs in the factories.<br>

Some unidentified persons have just time-bombed the Jusmag bldg. this morning. Only one PA Sgt. assigned there wounded but considerable damage to the building.<br>

A disturbing piece of news from Joe Maristela is that Gens. Ileto and Tanabe have promised support to the Adevoso Junta in their assassination and coup d’etat planning. We must check this and neutralize them. But I will first personally meet with Joe Maristela tomorrow night.<br>
This is compounded by the fact that the process will necessarily go up if we set free the rate of exchange. Then we will impose more taxes and for the next six months we will not be able to relax credit or government expenses, nor imports. I must increase the entry of tax-free goods into the Free Trade Zone and soon.<br>
One of the PSA (Intelligence) Sgt. Retuta, in civilian clothes as a photographer was mauled by the student demonstrators today in front of the palace. No reason except that he was allegedly infiltrating. This should get us some sympathy.<br>
The demonstrators (some ten of them) are still there with their mike shouting unprintable and vicious imprecations at me, Meldy and everybody. You can hear them in all rooms of the Palace except our bedroom and the study.<br>
They want P10 million to be released to their schools for such things like a gym for the Phil. Normal College. These public works releases have been suspended in accordance with the new policy of priorities and savings in the last six months of this fiscal year of P243 million.<br>
We will have to tolerate such irritating demonstrations until we lift this policy.<br>

I have just talked to Joe Maristela who is our informer in the Adevoso group planning a coup d’etat. He feels the plan, though fantastic, is serious. Their next meeting is at his house in Antipolo next Wednesday. And the political group backing them up may attend. He feels they have not yet talked to or gotten the support of Gens.

He attends a breakfast with Gen. Yan tomorrow at 7:30 AM.<br>
A Col. Navarro now in Vietnam who may be in the CIA and ex-Col. Francisco Jimenez as well as Marcelo Castillo (Annapolis 1939) are with them.<br>
He and Col. Ver have already planned the planting of some more officers and men in the Adevoso group.<br>
Adevoso says that my erstwhile opponent and he went to see Byroade after the elections. While Byroade was apparently non-committal he allowed Adevoso to talk to his staff who (Adevoso says) thought of the idea of a coup d’etat, Patterson DOD attaché suggesting that in order to cut off Malacañang from reinforcements, the three bridges, Quezon bridge, Nagtahan bridge and Ayala bridge be blown up.<br>
Col. Francisco Jimenez’s car was in Commodore Alcaraz’s residence last Saturday in their last meeting, although he (Jimenez) was not there. Jimenez is on of the Valeriano boys. This is a new variable.<br>
Joe and Col. Ver suggested that we meet force with force and that the conspirators be eliminated quietly before they prejudice our country and democratic institutions. I told them that instead we should obtain evidence to prosecute them in court.<br>
For otherwise we may unleash a wave of violence we may not be able to control and do greater damage to our freedoms.<br>

I have just directed the retirement of Gen. Raval and all the extended generals effective Feb 1st and April 1st. I will retain Gen. Yan as Chief of Staff only because there is no one who is qualified to take his place. I will put Gen. Eddie Garcia presently CG of the Tabak Division as PC chief.<br>
I do sympathize with Gen. Raval who claims  he had nothing to do with the abuses of the Special Forces but there is discontent in the rank and file of the Armed Forces and Gen. Raval is one of the reasons. Another is the feeling of the lower ranking officers that they have no hope of advancement. And with the efforts of the Liberals to intrigue the military into a coup d’etat, it becomes necessary to remove all causes of grievance.<br>
The truth of the matter is the retiring officers are better than those who will succeed them. I hope to place some of them in civilian positions.<br>
I cannot choose a replacement of Sec. Mata. I am trying to get a civilian and non-military man. But I guess I will ultimately push Gen. Yan up to Secretary of National Defense while I ultimately push Ileto up to Chief of Staff.<br>

I met with the labor leaders for breakfast after the oath-taking of the new Court of Appeals Justices including Vicente Rafael, labor leader is objected to by Justice Roman Ozaeta of the Philippine Bar Association, as he (Vicente) was allegedly an undistinguished labor practitioner. Also met the extended generals who I am retiring. Gen. Sangalang says he has no truck provided that they will all be terminated at the same time. I referred the suggestion to the Sec. of Nat. Defense thru the C of S Gen. Yan.<br>
Sec. Romualdez has his misgivings about the plan to free the rate of exchange and to allow it to seek its own level. He is worried it may plunge down too low. Dr. Zabvkar says from his experience it will not. Anyway I have ordered that we be ready with some foreign exchange to support a more stable rate and to finance the importation of essentials.<br>

January 26, 1970<br>
Monday<br>
11:05 PM<br>
Opening session of Congress. State of the Nation Address and Riots by the demonstrators in front of Congress.<br>
Two students reported killed. Phil. Gen. Hospital Dir. Pascual reports 45 demonstrators and 5 policemen treated. Cars in Congress destroyed like that of Sen. Roy.<br>
The invocation of Father Pacifico Ortiz, Ateneo head, was in poor taste. It castigated the government referring to goons, high prices, streets not being safe, the threat of revolution and how the citizens were ready to fight for their rights even in the barricades.<br>
It was an attempt at the state of the nation. I hope he is happy with what he has helped to bring about.<br>
Raul Manglapus engineered this with the help of the Jesuits apparently for all the Catholic schools had delegations. But apparently they were infiltrated by the Kabataan Makabayan who with some students started the violence.<br>
After the State of the Nation address, which was perhaps my best so far, and we were going down the front stairs, the bottles, placard handles, stones and other missiles started dropping all around us on the driveway to the tune of a “Marcos, Puppet” chant.<br>
As the intelligence reports it, the demonstrators had brought a coffin which they carried from the street below to the site of the flagpole, when they pushed it into the faces of the policemen. The policemen then threw the coffin to the street below and may have hit two demonstrators. The latter then took out a stuffed alligator from inside the coffin and threw it at the policemen who threw it back. Then the wood, bottle and stone throwing which caught us at the front stairs. I could not go into the car as Imelda kept standing on the stairs. Col. Ver tried to push me inside but I ordered the First Lady to be fetched and put inside first. Since she could not be pulled by anyone, I had to do it myself. I am afraid I pushed her into the car floor much too hard. Anyway I bumped my head behind the right ear against the car’s door side and twisted my weak right ankle again. We moved out under a hail of stones. But the PSA agent covering me, Agent Suson, was hit in the forehead and left eyelid and took four stitches. I thought it was Col. Ver as his barong was splashed with splotches of blood but Suson’s blood had spilled on him as he was on my right.<br>
We saw some of the action over television after we arrived at the palace.<br>
Raul Manglapus is hoping to become the President of the Constitutional Convention.<br>
And the extremists are using these demonstrators to provoke violence for their purposes.<br>
Some advisors are quietly recommending sterner measures against the Kabataang Makabayan. We must get the emergency plan polished up.<br>

12:10 PM —<br>
Imelda left for Leyte to attend the installation of the Bishop of Palo. Have just called her up by phone patch. She says Ulot is so beautiful, the Papal Nuncio says it is more beautiful than Napoli. The moon is out. It is a three quarter fading moon.<br>
Met with all the Chiefs of Police in the Metropolitan area, the Metrocom Chief &amp; his staff, the PC chief and his staff and the NBI chief. Asked Col. Tamayo and Barbers to report on the rioting yesterday. I requested that the charges against the students be dropped; charges against non-students can continue; that a critique be made of the conduct of the men in uniform; that steps be taken to prevent any injuries to demonstrators in the future as there are reports of individual cases of policemen using more force than necessary. The MPD Chief explained that in the melee and the mob action, it was difficult to say what are the proper limits to the use of force to meet force. They asked for additional equipment as the policemen have to buy their own helmets and baton. About 19 policemen were injured.<br>
As reported by Ignacio Lacsina, his NUTC men in the rally saw Roger Arienda and his men start the rioting by throwing the coffin, the stuffed crocodile and stones at my car. I have asked Col. Ver to get their affidavits.<br>
I also met at 10:45 with Ambassador Byroade whom I quietly confronted with the story the Liberals are spreading openly that the American Embassy is supporting an attempt at a coup d’etat. He claims they only listened to the need for a coup. I told him of Patterson’s suggestion to blow up the bridges to isolate Malacañang. He seemed stunned and said he was greatly concerned and would do something about it. He said as long as he &amp; Nixon were in position we would not be fighting Americans.<br>
[Marginal note: I am a little relieved by his apparent willingness to cooperate with me.]<br>

<strong>Malacañang</strong><br>
January 28, 1970<br>
Wednesday 11:50 PM<br>
The pattern of subversion is slowly emerging. The danger is now apparent to me but not to most people.<br>
The conspiracy to grab power and assassinate me and about a hundred officers. The terrorism in Central Luzon with the HMB’s and the Ma-Mao holding some towns in their power. The repeated cases of liquidation of government sympathizers, informers and agents; the pink intellectuals, writers, professors and students and fellow travelers. Then the time bomb in Jusmag. The riot in Congress last Monday. Now the UP faculty marches to Malacañang tomorrow and denounces police brutality and holds the administration responsible for the “policy of repression” and the “violation of rights”. Then another mass demonstration that may lead to another riot next Friday notwithstanding promises of Gargaritano, the Security officer of the student demonstrators [in the conference this afternoon in the palace] that he will coordinate with MPD chief Tamayo to maintain peace.<br>
And I am certain this is just the beginning. The newspapermen I have in my list are busy placing the government in disrepute and holding it in contempt before the people. The sabotage and the killings will continue. The slow chipping at the people’s confidence in government authority. If we do not prepare measures of counter-action, they will not only succeed in assassinating me but in taking over the government.<br>
So we must perfect our emergency plan.<br>
I have several options. One of them is to abort the subversive plan now by the sudden arrest of the plotters. But this would not be accepted by the people. Nor could we get the Huks, their legal cadres and support. Nor the MIM and other subversive [or front] organizations, nor those underground.<br>
We could allow the situation to develop naturally then after massive terrorism, wanton killings and an attempt at my assassination and a coup d’etat, then declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus – and arrest all including the legal cadres.<br>
Right now I am inclined towards the latter.<br>
The student demonstrators seem to want a parliamentary form of government.<br>
If I want to be perpetuated in power, this is the easier way to it, with a constitutional provision that there shall be no elections unless a majority of all members of a unicameral legislature should adopt a formal resolution asking for such elections – and the powers of the Prime Minister are those of the President now.<br>

<strong>Malacañang</strong><br>
January 29, 1970<br>
Thursday<br>
The UP faculty had a demonstration this afternoon. They walked from Agrifina Circle to Malacañang, handed me a manifesto blaming the administration for “the pattern of repression.”<br>
No mention at all about who started the stoning nor the danger to the First Lady and me – nothing but police brutality.<br>
Dean Majul claimed they were referring to the government in general and that he who heads a house is responsible for the happenings in that house. Dean Escudero of Business Adm. says he was a Marcos Liberal and that it is a matter of faith. Dean Feria (apparently an American lady) of English says there was brutality, that her 17 year old daughter was near our car and did not see any stone thrown (she must need glasses otherwise where did the wound of Agent Tuson in the forehead come from). Dr. Francisco Nemenzo arrogantly proclaimed he was not content with the manifesto but after “seeing my reaction to it”, he was happy. I had said that I was disappointed in the faculty of my alma matter; that the UP was charged as the spawning ground of communism and that the manifesto was full of ambiguous generalities that had a familiar ring to them. Then I read a report that he had said he wanted the members of the faculty to be hurt by the police and that he had given directions to the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation to prepare gasoline (apparently for Molotov cocktails), stones and other missiles to be used in the Friday (Jan. 30th) rally, and that in the charge of communism in the UP, his name was mentioned.<br>
Tomorrow, the big student rally. But Gargaritano of the youth reform movement says the NUSP and the NSI will not come to Malacañang but go to Congress instead. The Kabataan Makabayan will come to Malacañang, though.<br>
Mayor Villegas has said that he will not allow the police to be near the demonstrators. I ordered him in writing to maintain peace and order in all rallies and demonstrations. He sent word that his press release did not mean he would keep the police away.<br>
I showed to the UP professors the <em>Collegian</em> which carried the communist party articles and said that I did not wish to stop this but that I hoped that the two sides of the question would be ventilated. VP Lopez called the editor of the <em>Collegian</em> a leftist.<br>

January 30, 1970, Friday<br>
4:00 PM<br>
Still very quiet. The Kabataang Makabayan has been able to muster only about a hundred demonstrators before Malacañang. To cover up their inadequate number, they have gone to Congress where the NUSP under Jopson and the NSL have a more impressive number. Ollera has alerted Gargaritano. There is a congressional hearing at 3:00 PM. At six o’clock the leaders come to Malacañang for a conference.<br>
I continued the dialogue with the students – this time from CLSU, with the various student leaders like Jose Sayson, this morning.<br>
1:00AM Jan 31st –The Ma-Maos and Dante Kabataang Makabayan are leading the rioting outside.<br>
The riot is still going on but the Metrocom under Col. Ordoñez and Aguilar after reinforcement by one company of the PC under Gen. Raval arrived have pushed up to Mendiola near San Beda where the MPD were held in reserve. I hear shooting and I am told that the MPD have been firing in the air.<br>
The rioters have been able to breach Gate 4 and I had difficulty to stop the guards from shooting the rioters down. Specially as when Gate 3 was threatened also. I received a call from Maj. Ramos for permission to fire and my answer was “Permission granted to fire your water hoses.”<br>
So no shooting inside the Malacañang compound. Otherwise it would have been a massacre.<br>

10:00 AM<br>
I write this tonight having been a little occupied last night during the demonstration or riot. I am glad I was able to hold back on the repeated requests to fire at the rioters, the first request when they took over a fire truck burned it and rammed it against Gate 4 broke the lock and rushed into the compound near the new Administration Bldg, the second when they threatened to do the same on Gate 3.<br>
Have delivered a TV speech, called all the mayors of Metropolitan Manila and Gen. Rodriguez to work out a coordinated plan. Mayor Villegas kept explaining why the MPD police did not come to help us in Malacañang (nor the fire trucks of the MFD either).<br>
Conferred with the military (Sec. of Nat Def, Chief of Staff, Chiefs of the major services and their staffs.)<br>
Then with the political leaders.<br>
Most felt there should be no repression. So I have had to delay the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. We will await developments. I understand the demonstrators will hit the PNB and Metropolitan Branches next. The PCC demonstration of Prudente was called off. But I gather there will be a big demonstration next Tuesday and/or Mar. 3rd.<br>
When they do so again, they may be armed with firearms. In the meantime I can only gnash my teeth and wait.<br>
These are difficult days for everybody. But I pity the citizenry caught in the crossfire last night. For the rioters were sniping at the MPD, Metrocom &amp; soldiers with .22’s.<br>
I suppose that the people now sympathize with me, specially if these vandals continue their destructive anarchy.<br>
But Chino Roces still seemed hostile in the meeting with the publishers when I requested support for my position in the matter of the rioters. And Teddy Locsin tonight could not see in it anything but that reform must come by violent means. I had forgotten that he had always written sympathetically of Mao Tse Tung.<br>
We should ride this out with patience and perseverance.<br>
Teddy apparently was warning me that if there was repression by the arrest of the leaders of the communist movement, there would be retaliation and Central Luzon would be transferred to Manila with the slums becoming the jungle.<br>
If I let these fears deter me from fighting communism then we are lost. But I must continue to restrain myself lest we lose the support of the people by a stance of tyranny.<br>

A Fr. Sheffeld of Germany is living in Ateneo and approves the expenditure of the Adenauer fund supposedly for research on constitutional reforms. This is alien intervention in internal affairs. Father John Doherty, Vice President of Ateneo for Academic Affairs says it may be used for the rallies and demonstrations as Manglapus and the student leaders went to Germany some time ago.<br>
Fr. Otazu, Rector of San Beda warns that the San Beda Towers if taken by the rioters could overlook Malacañang. So I have ordered it to be secured. Both felt that I have taken too soft a stand against the rioters and that the students do not believe my warning yesterday.<br>
Perhaps they are right but we must not adopt a stance of arrogance but of humility. And if the terrorism continues then we must meet force with force. Only however if the anarchists continue the sabotage and terrorism.<br>
I asked Gen. Balao, now Reparations Minister in Tokyo and former Defense Secretary to take over the Defense portfolio tonight. Sec. Mata was drunk during the crisis on Friday night as he is drunk every night. He is not only useless. He is a security risk.<br>

<strong>“WHY I AM FIGHTING COMMUNISM”</strong><br>
<strong>Office of the President</strong><br>
<strong>of the Philippines</strong><br>
<strong>Malacañang</strong><br>
February 1, 1970<br>
To my children, Imee, Bongbong and Irene:<br>
Why I am fighting Communism<br>
**1.**Because it does not believe in God. It believes that everything that happens is brought about by man alone. It believes in the theory of dialectic materialism. I believe in God.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="590" data-line-end="591">Under communism, a man has no rights. He is a creature of the State. It is the State that is glorified not man. So man becomes a slave under communism.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="591" data-line-end="592">Under communism, a man has no freedom. In contradistinction to democracy where individual freedom is sacrosanct, communism does not allow such simple liberties as freedom of thought, speech and religion among many others. There is no such thing as dissent or debate or dialogue.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="592" data-line-end="593">Correspondingly, under communism a man may own no land as he may not own any production goods. The cry of land for the landless is a mere shibboleth. For the land belongs to the state and the farmers are only slaves of the state. The farmers get a share of the produce byt only such share as the State arbitrarily dictates.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="593" data-line-end="594">Communism is a totalitarianism or a dictatorship by the elite who have acquired power through force, killing, murder and coercion. Prime examples are Stalin and Mao Tse Tung.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="594" data-line-end="595">Correspondingly the common people that communism is supposed to serve do not have any share in government nor in decision-making. Communism does not allow such simple processes as an election or voting or political campaigns. Everything is dictated by the few or the man on top who got there by force or violence.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="595" data-line-end="596">The common people, the laborers, farmers and the employees, cannot rise beyond their level. They cannot send their children to school to become lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers or attain any profession they may wish. The State, meaning the ruling elite, determines what the people become. There is no alternative.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="596" data-line-end="597">Communism gives no inducement to genius, talent, perseverance and hard work. Everybody is pulled down to a common wage or salary except the rulers who live in a state of luxury and privilege.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="597" data-line-end="599">Communism ostensibly seeks to eradicate the ruling or influential oligarchies. But it succeeds in only replacing them with a worse group – the ruling or influential cliques and elite who actually rule without the approval or consent of the people. These group of elitists cannot be changed except by violence or force – by a revolution.<br>
10. Communism ostensibly seeks to drive away the foreign colonialists in the Philippines, the Americans. But it would place the Philippines under a new alien power – Red China, which is worse. Our country should be free and not dominate by any alien power.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="599" data-line-end="603">Communism believes in violence as the principal weapon of policy or of change. “Power comes out of the barrel of a gun,” is its principal dictum. Everytime there has been change in a communist country, there has been killing, arson, pillage and destruction – wasteful, merciless and senseless. In contradistinction to this, democracy offers change through the democratic process of elections and free speech in the open market of ideas. The process may be creaky, unwieldy and sometimes frustrating, but comparatively, it is humane, Christian, wiser, more democratic and less wasteful.<br>
Let us improve the house we now have, [which] we call democracy – for it has defects. But let us not burn it down.<br>
(Sgd.) F.E. Marcos<br>

12:20 AM<br>
It seems clear now that the demonstrations and riots are engineered by the Liberal Party, Commander Dante and the Lopezes. The affidavit of a student leader, Villalon, attests to seven meetings in the office of my opponent Osmeña and Liberal Party President Gerry Roxas where these events were planned.<br>
But we must calm everybody down as the rumors of a revolution are widespread and the rich in Forbes Park have fled their beautiful homes. I have told the PA Commander (Gen Ileto) to patrol Forbes Park.<br>
After the calm, we can then attend to the enemies of the Republic one by one.<br>
Pressure must be put on Dante so he will not be of help to the Liberals in Manila. Perhaps we should get Sumulong to give Dante a work out to keep him busy or eliminate him. Will tell the military this.<br>
Then we must develop the case against the Liberals and the Lopezes so we can proceed against them legally.<br>
But we must move fast as the Liberals have July as their target date and the Communists Jan. 1971 (the latter information) according to Villegas whom I saw secretly at Pangarap tonight.<br>

The threat to turn the funerals of the four dead students into a mass rally has failed so far as the parents of the victims refused to allow the dead bodies to be further utilized to inflame the youth.<br>
There is comparative quiet although there was a scare of the students entering and burning the fashionable villages of Forbes Park, Urdaneta, Magallanes, etc, and the rich residents have evacuated. As Teddy Locsin said quoting the good book “The guilty flee where no one pursueth while the innocent are bold as a lion.<br>
With the statements of the young student leader Villalon and the former CIS chief Joe Maristela, I am now convinced that the Liberals have planned and organized these demonstrations in preparation for an alleged revolution.<br>
We must unmask these would be anarchists hiding behind children.<br>
And now Ninoy Aquino, Manny Pelaez and even Doy Laurel have started to discredit the Armed Forces. They delivered their privilege speeches yesterday.<br>

[<em>Marginal note</em>: Played golf with the Malacañang reporters at 5:00 PM]<br>
1:30 AM —<br>
Everything has returned to normalcy. But I feel that the HMB’s with Dante and Ninoy masterminding them are planning some sabotage.<br>
Talked to Ex-Sen. Rodolfo Ganzon and Ex-Rep Raschid Lucman and his wife Princess Tarhata.<br>
I have asked Roding Ganzon to infiltrate the LP. He says that Lopez, Laurel and Osmeña have agreed on an NP-LP ticket in 1973. Osmeña wants to run again and Doy Laurel may be his Vice. But of course Gerry Roxas and Ninoy Aquino want to run as President.<br>
And Lucman I asked to keep peace in Lanao and to placate the Liberals.<br>
Boni Isip, Joe Luckban and Johnny Echiverri saw me. They told me of Joe Maristela and of Ex-Sen Estanislao Fernandez urging the students to attack at Mendiola and plying them with whiskey from a jeep without any number and loaded with whiskey bottles.<br>
I hope to see Rep. Salipada Pendatun, brother in law of Ex. Gov. Udtog Matalam, leader of the Moslem Independence Movement, tomorrow. As well as Ex-Sen. Domocao Alonto and Ex-Gen. Alonto.<br>
We are building pillboxes at the gates and mortar defenses including baffled walls for my gymnasium where we can seek shelter in case of mortar attack.<br>
We have cleared the lawn west of the veranda and ceremonial hall for a helicopter landing this side of the Palace complete with night landing lights.<br>
We are preparing anti-subversion cases against Arienda and the leaders of the Kabataang Makabayan.<br>
I feel that ultimately we must have a confrontation with the communists in this country. And that their eradication as a threat to our free way of life may be one of my main missions. It is true that if we can keep on delaying and delaying their take-off and cut off their momentum we will ultimately win, but it will be a messy and tedious job. Now we have an opportunity – perhaps the only opportunity to liquidate the movement in one clean sweep – if we plan it well enough.<br>
Thus if there is massive sabotage and an attempt against my life, then I might be compelled to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and arrest all the persons in the list of communists.<br>
This will be the total solution to the ideological impasse!<br>

Called Ambassador Byroade to find out if they (the Americans) are supporting me in the fight against the subversives. He said they would. Whatever they have done to encourage intransigence among the Liberals, we should neutralize them before a total confrontation with the communists. To satisfy the American ego I asked for the accelerated delivery of the helicopters and some ammunition for both training and combat.<br>
My principal worry, however, is the effect of the IMF program of a free rate of exchange. This will cause further increase in prices beyond the reach of the common man. My barber, Conrad, tells me that money is becoming scarce.<br>
Byroade handed me his letter informing me that Pres. Nixon would like to receive me in California in mid or late August. I have accepted the invitation but I have delayed the publicity. This may cause another demonstration.<br>
Asked Rep. Salipada Pendatun to keep peace in Cotabato and put some sense into the Liberals.<br>
We are now preparing for the military confrontation with communism. Legal studies on whether an arrest can be made without warrant if I suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and if the arresting officer can be charged for illegal detention when the writ is restored. Then an assessment of the evidence against the target personalities.<br>
We must prepare for a legal fight.<br>
<strong>ATTACHMENT</strong><br>
<strong>Letter of Ambassador Byroade (Page 1 of 2)</strong><br>
Manila, Philippines<br>
February 3, 1970<br>
Dear Mr. President:<br>
You will undoubtedly recall that in your recent discussion with Vice President Agnew, the latter extended President Nixon’s invitation for you to pay a visit to the United States and suggested late 1970 or early 1971. During that conversation mention was made of the fact that many Heads of States would be going to America for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Session of the United [Nations]. The Vice President later pointed out to you his thought that this would hardly be good timing from our point of view as with so many visitors it might be difficult to give your own visit the priority and attention that he knew President Nixon would desire. I believe, but am not certain, that Vice President Agnew suggested that a later date might be preferable.<br>
I now have the authority to explore with you the possibility of a somewhat earlier date of mid or late August. If such timing would prove convenient to you, I am informed that President Nixon would like to receive you in California as he has found that that locale has proven ideal for comparable state occasions. I have been informed also that he would like a Pacific coast setting<br>
 <br>
His Excellency<br>
Ferdinand E. Marcos<br>
President of the Republic of the Philippines<br>
<strong>(Page 2 of 2)</strong><br>
for the actual meeting with you as he feels this would lend emphasis to the mutual interests of our two countries in the Pacific community.<br>
I will be most pleased, of course, to pass along your thoughts on this matter.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
(Sgd.) Henry A. Byroade<br>

Poor Banjo Raval (Gen. Vicente Raval) the Chief of PC. He is one of the most loyal of the officers in the Armed Forces. I have asked him to seek relief as PC Chief. Instead of Gen. Eduardo Garcia, I may have to put Gen. Tanabe temporarily.<br>
I intend to make a sweeping reorganization of the cabinet, financing institutions and the tax collecting offices. So I meet with the Development Council tomorrow to chart the program on social legislation. This will include price and rent control, special funds for peace and order and for land reform. Housing and resettlement must receive priority attention.<br>
Have met with Labor Leader Ignacio Lacsina (NATU), Peasant leader Felixberto Olalia (Masaka) and Kabataan Makabayan leader Carlos del Rosario brought in be Sec. Blas Ople. They have asked a more nationalistic policy. I told them that it has saddened me to be driven to the refuge of anti-communism and pro-Americanism. I offered them the opportunity to obtain loans from the Eastern European Socialist countries; retirement of Gen. Raval and the disbandment of the “monkees” as well as the prosecution of Col. Tomas Diaz and his men for the alleged kidnapping of Alabado. They promised in turn to call off the Feb. 12th rally and to meet with me on Tuesday Feb. 10th at 5:00 PM at the State Dining Room.<br>

Met Byroade who says we can pick up the tear gas next Monday. The dye will be forthcoming and he hopes he can divert to the Philippines three helicopters for Vietnam and two for Thailand. He says he has to fight the Vietnan priority.<br>
Tonight I also met with Roger Arienda, one of my most bitter critics who has been leading demonstrations. He was brought by Col. Simeon Medalla. Of course he suggested that he puts up an office to receive complaints and funds to support the office. He now supports me.<br>
Submitted to the National Development Council the priority legislative program as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="700" data-line-end="701">Price and Rent Control Law</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="701" data-line-end="715">Special funds for:

Doy Laurel proposed the inclusion of judicial and penal reforms.<br>
But they opposed the proclamation of all of Luzon as a land reform area allegedly for lack of funds to finance the tenants. We agreed to finance the existing land reform areas first. Otherwise we would lose further credibility.<br>
I had to tell the Senators and Congressmen that the demonstrators and the radicals felt that Congress was hopeless because it was moving along as slowly as usual and not acting as if there was need for immediate change.<br>
Met with my cabinet to inform them that we had to meet the demand for change. So everybody held himself available for replacement. I have prepared a proposed revamp.<br>
But in the <em>Manila Times</em>, Pastalero, former UP Student Council President, follows Barican’s line that I should resign. So it is not constitutional reforms they want but a change of President. This should unmask them.<br>
<em>Manila Times</em> has become impossible. Chino Roces has become a juramentado. He asked the Umali group of farmers to join the demonstration on the 12th so as to get me to resign in three months. He must be a mental case as I always suspected. Manang Pacita says he is trying to prove his manhood elsewhere as he is inadequate at home.<br>
Rudy Tupas and Abe Cruz who saw Imelda claim they will be able to stop him from inside the <em>Manila Times</em>.<br>

Sunday<br>
11:15 PM–<br>
I have sworn in the new cabinet members during my speech before the Constitutional Convention members during the cocktail for them at 5:00 PM at the reception hall except for the new Executive Secretary, Alex Melchor whom I swore in the evening at 7:10 when Iñing Lopez and Nanding, Heny Lopez and the <em>Chronicle</em> and ABS-CBN staff came to have dinner with us.<br>
Iñing was very touchy, even arrogant, Heny was non-committal and IP Soliongco kept reapeating that nothing would be the same again and that we would have to listen to the voice of the students as this was the voice of the people.<br>
I kept repeating to Ernie Granada that he should not push me to Byroade and the Americans.<br>
It is my feeling that the Lopezes are going to do their best to undermine against us.<br>
Met with Tony Pastalero brought by Angel Concepcion, former secretary of Sen. Camilo Osias, as well as Fernando (Gerry) Barican this noon for lunch with the first and the latter at 4:00 PM. They both promised to stop the talk about my resignation after I convinced them that if I were not around the military would take over. This is apparently feared by everyone including them.<br>
Barican today has warned of a take over by the Jesuit-Fascist-CIA combine.<br>
We really should warn our people of this. But today I met also with the Jesuit novices who want to be strengthened by my granting their demands (of the NUSP). I agreed to this to widen the split between them (the moderates) and the radicals.<br>

9:40 PM<br>
I write this as I wait for a visitor who will inform us of all the conspiracy going on behind the Liberal Party. Osmeña has just delivered a privilege speech in the Senate denying his connection with the demonstrators and the riots and rehashing his charges about the elections.<br>
Villalon testifying before the Senate-House Joint Committee should blast this claim to pieces. Col. Jimmy Barbers has asked for an opportunity to present him next Wednesday at 9:00 AM.<br>
Went out of the Palace (for the first time since Jan. 30, 1970) to attend the 31st Anniversary of the Phil. Navy set at 9:00 AM. Stayed until 11:00 AM. Commissioned the new 25-know 87 ft. patrol craft made in Singapore. Our Navy will duplicate it. We have a 100 ft. ferro-cement fishing boat in the making.<br>
Was gratified to see the people waving at me and clapping their hands. The public sympathy has returned to us since the attack on the Palace on Jan. 30th.<br>
Apparently the crisis is over – unless the Feb. 12th rallies turn into violent riots, God forbid.<br>
The whole family was in Scout uniform at the 5:00 o’clock investiture of Imelda and the opening ceremonies of the preparation for the 50th Anniversary of Scouting in 1973.<br>
Conferred with the two Cardinals, Santos and Rosales, on the Jesuits and bishops propagating radical ideas – like Father Ortiz, Murphy (Tom) and Blanco as well as the seven bishops who sent the open letter.<br>
Now even the student leaders are divided. They seem to be in a state of confusion. Tonight 25 students from the UP have seen the First Lady. Uncivil, arrogant but uninformed, naïve and confused.<br>
I see the KM and Labor leaders with Blas Ople tomorrow at 5:00 PM.<br>
But the NUSP is following the script of making demands which I am supposed to grant – to strengthen their hand. And they are supposed to picket Malacañang tomorrow.<br>
Even if the demonstrations should turn violent because the latest intelligence is that Commander Dante is supposed to be collecting hand guns in Concepcion and supposedly in the province of Tarlac, for use in Manila, it would still be favorable to us for the people are against violence – specially if it is against Malacañang Palace.<br>
We must recast the plans for a total solution of the communist problem. We must prepare for a long, tedious legal fight with the military stepping up the drive in Central Luzon and harassing raids in Novaliches, Caloocan and Parañaque where the HMBs and the Mao’s hold in when they escape from the PC raids in Central Luzon.<br>
Gov. Licaros sent a message through Bobby Benedicto who is agreed to going out on leave from the Presidency of the PNB, that his mission is a complete success.<br>
We will get the third tranche of $27.5 million $40 m from out gold $40 from the Federal Reserve Bank and $120 million from the consortium of banks plus a five year extension of our debts. If we can get $100 m from Japan, we will have all we need.<br>
Now all I am asking for is to be allowed to start working.<br>

Have just met with the KM, NATU, MASAKA, from 6:00 PM to 11:15 PM. They claim they will not engage in a hate-Marcos campaign but will limit their demonstration to the campuses and prevent violence.<br>
Now the NUSP also want to meet with me. And so do the Upsilonians.<br>
We are succeeding in dividing the student leaders into the radicals and the moderates.<br>
Have had to grant some of their demands – things that I wanted to do anyway.<br>
But four enlisted men were killed at Mapalacsiao, Tarlac, by men believed to be Maos at 1:00 AM today.<br>
The demands of the radicals are socialistic if not communist – not merely nationalistic. We will have to play along with them, take away their steam while we go after the Maos and the HMBs.<br>
Imelda met with the two Cardinals, Archbishops Gonzaga and Alberto on the problem of the Jesuits and the ultra-liberal priests. They intend to put yup a magazine and a newspaper.<br>
Have asked Gen. Menzi to resign his position as Senior Aide so he can devote his full time to the <em>Bulletin</em>, <em>Liwayway</em>, his business interests and the preparation of a house in Australia and San Francisco if necessary.<br>

Comparative quiet. The radicals have called off their rally in Plaza Miranda and will probably hold rallies in the campuses. Met with the UP moderates headed by Gordon and Ortega. They are planning to put up their newspaper.<br>
Commander Sumulong sent word through Danding Cojuangco that the rioting in Malacañang was brought about by the CIA. Jim Rafferty had said that he had made inquiries about the squatters and they had refused to join the rally. This, he said was different from Indonesia, where they had.<br>
Commander Sumulong is going after Commander Dante in Tarlac. He says Dante was wounded in a previous skirmish and may be moving around in a hammock. Danding suspects that Ninoy Aquino is hiding him in either Antipolo, Puringay or in the Joe Rojas ranch in Bataan. Sumulong promises to get him.<br>
Col. Tomas Diaz is now Zone-2 and needs ₱80,000 for six civilian jeeps, one jeep each for the six teams and six more vehicles plus ₱10,000 monthly. We will start going after those Ma-Maos in a big way.<br>
Have asked Bobby Benedicto to join Licaros in the U.S… He has sought a leave of absence preparatory to retirement. Executive Vice Pres Villatuya is Acting President of PNB.<br>
Am still looking for replacements in the BIR, Customs and the financing institutions as well as Undersecretaries of Defense, Justice and Commerce.<br>
Have asked Dir. _______ of Forestry to locate 1,000 hectares near Manila and 1,000 hectares in Bataan near the Free Trade Zone for my resettlement projects.<br>
Have appointed Gen. Tobias as Gen. Man. of the National Housing Corporation. I hope to build 1,000 low-cost houses a month.<br>

Against predictions of violence, the Plaza Miranda rally turned out to be peaceful. Some of the leaders shouted for the crowd to go to Malacañang but the crowd would not follow.<br>
But the KM and SDK violated their word and went through with the rally in Plaza Miranda when they had said that they would not leave the campuses. Some 40 trucks came from Angeles City. The men in them did not look like students and they were the ones crying out for blood.<br>
The northern congressmen, senators and governors came to the palace with completely armed men. I dissuaded them from infiltrating the demonstration and inflicting harm on them.<br>
For a time I secretly hoped that the demonstrators would attack the palace so that we could employ the total solution. But it would be bloody and messy.<br>
Anyway I told the northern political leaders that the situation may develop into a revolutionary situation during my administration and that we should prepare for a military confrontation with the communists. The North should be developed as a last bastion, just in case. We must now cache arms and ammo there, prepare Laoag for jet landings, Lingayen Gulf for our navy and organize provincial strike forces, at the rate first of at least 100 men each province.<br>
But we must win the hearts and minds of our people. So, I argued, we must all be ready to sacrifice our personal interests for the common good. They agreed to this but begged that the men who had sacrificed in the political battles be not forgotten.<br>
We had dinner and a movie. Blas Ople was there for dinner. And so was Emong Salvador, my old Maharlika comrade. Blas is an enigma. Many of the leaders distrust him. Even Col. Ver feels that he is actually one of the communist leaders and that all the attacks in the media against me and the administration may have been his brainchild. But it is best he is in the palace when there is a crisis. Then we can neutralize him or use him.<br>
As of now I am convinced we have to wage a tedious legal, propaganda and economic battle against the communists. So this afternoon I asked the military leaders, Ponce Enrile, Yan, Garcia, and Ramos to prepare for this. There must be an assessment of the voluminous documents captured from the Ma-Maos – for legal action. The intelligence agencies must be sharpened to the sophisticated finesse of the intellectuals and urban communists. For this the NICA and NBI must be reorganized. And we must fund the various anti-subversion and anti-insurgency teams.<br>
If they want a revolution, I will give them one in the economic field. Drastic, dramatic and effective like the rechanneling of the excess money into agro-industrial projects in the farms and resettlement centers.<br>
I met with Vicente Araneta to listen to his priming plan. Assigned Usec. Roman Ong Jr. to study it.<br>

Col. Ver reports that de Leon has just come back from Samar where the men of Osmeña numbering about 300 are training with an American among them. We must find out if this is Larry Trackman. De Leon brought two samples of home made bombs – beer bottles with gun powder and a fuse.<br>
We must track down these training camps and eradicate them.<br>
Met with Father Blanco, the revolutionary priest. He seemed impressed with the crash program of employment with me calling the 600 biggest employers in the Manila area and asking them to take five to ten unemployed – then the housing program in Tondo, Tala Leprosarium, Sapang Palay, Carmona, San Pedro Tunasan; the free trade zone and the sale of essential commodities without payment of tariff or tax if necessary; the agro-industrial estates and the Magalang project under a private foundation, the Filipinas Foundation of the Ayalas.<br>

Adevoso’s group has postponed its meeting set Wednesday. They must smell something.<br>
But de Leon says the barracks in this secret training place in Northern Samar is so camouflaged that it cannot be seen from the air. It is a long building roofed with galvanized iron over which tree bark and soil is spread. Two Americans went there four times in the about two weeks that he was there by small plane which are then covered with tree foliage. He does not know their names but will try to get their pictures as well as that of the place when they return Wednesday. He was with an Atty. Tumulak, Osmeña’s man, when he went there last.<br>
I have now asked the 3rd PC Zone Commander, Gen. Reyes, to come with the CIS officer, Maj. Manglongat. There is one Home Defense Force in this zone and it should be used against this camp.<br>
Gov. Licaros has called up by long distance to report that the IMF team’s (headed by Dr. Zabvkar) report will be submitted to the IMF Board next Friday the 20th and will be approved. The third credit tranche of $27.5 million will be granted, $40 million loan for Central Bank working balance from the consortium of 23 U.S. banks $40 million loan from the Federal Reserve Bank and possibly $60 million standby loan from the consortium. He leaves for Tokyo next Tuesday where we hope to borrow $200 million standby and $50 million trade credits.<br>
The dollar now costs ₱6.10 – a new high.<br>
This is what concerns me most because if it goes any lower, we will have inflation and instability. Then there may be riots.<br>
We must now pass the price control bill I certified last Thursday (Feb. 12th) and the rent control bill. Then we must allow the entry of essential commodities to be stocked in the Free Trade Zone at Mariveles.<br>
We must soon allow the expenditure of funds for highways and ports because while there is money in Manila, there is beginning to be a pinch in the provinces.<br>
I should record the attempt of Angel Nepomuceno, co-owner (with Bibit Duavit) of the Butterfly and who is now keeping Gerry Barican at his house, and Tony Pastalero to hold me up for ₱150,000 for alleged expenses during the Alcantara funeral when allegedly they used 250 students to prevent any untoward event – allegedly committed by Tony Raquiza. Tony Raquiza denied this to me yesterday when he came to see me playing golf alone at about 6:30 PM. He says he did not convey this to me as he found the proposal obnoxious as it smacked of blackmail.<br>
The students have their weaknesses.<br>

Was guest of honor of the convention for the merger of the two biggest labor unions, the P_C of Bert Oca and the PTUC of Pedro Fernandez at 4:00 PM at the GSIS auditorium. They constitute 65% of the organized labor force. They welcomed me warmly and applauded my speech enthusiastically. This will show that labor is on the side of government and not leftist as claimed by the KM and SDP.<br>
This is the second time I leave the palace. I should do so more often.<br>
Had lunch with Gen. Rancudo, CG of the Fifth Fighter Wing who swore undying loyalty even if the other elements of the AFP should turn disloyal. “One of my F-5’s can blast the Tabak Division installations in ten minutes,” he said. He said he is willing to fight even the Americans if necessary. I hurried to add that the Americans were on our side. He had the CAA Administrator, Fred Ablan, with him (he is another jet fighter pilot). I ordered Laoag airfield which is only 5000 long to be immediately lengthened to 10,000 so as to handle jet transport (commercial) as an alternative international airport. Actually this is to handle our jet fighters. The same thing with Zamboanga and Davao.<br>
I have given the project on the Osmeña training camp in Samar to Gen. Ben Reyes, III PC Zone Commander and his C/S Chief, Maj. Manglongat who strikes me as competent. Aerial photography may locate the area. And vertical envelopment by helicopter or by air drop may do the trick.<br>
Imelda is again very confident that I have things well in hand. So does Father Dougherty fee the same way.<br>

Spent practically the whole day attending to the problems of the Tondo foreshoreland  slum dwellers. They ask for the land reclaimed from the sea at North Harbor. Last year I gave ₱350,000 to the Bureau of Lands in their presence to spend for the survey and subdivision of the land into residential lots excluding the customs area and land set aside for roads, parks and recreational facilities which they now wish to do away with.<br>
I have given them the responsibility of deciding the conflicting claims and the problems of more than 5,000 applicants to only 3,000 lots if the parks, roads and recreational facilities are included as residential land. And I explained the program of housing (requesting that if it is necessary to accommodate several families in one lot they should agree to condominiums in three or two storey apartments), education through the foster-parent plan of businessmen and employment.<br>
Met with the business leaders on the Tondo problem of housing, education and employment.<br>
Then talked to the Blue Ladies on the capabilities of government to protect them and what government is doing to bring about change.<br>
Asked Enriquito Zobel in the businessman’s meeting to hurry up the Magalang project of the Filipinas Foundation.<br>

I have that feeling of certainty that I will end up with dictatorial powers if the situation continues – and the situation will continue. The HMBs and the Ma-Maos will continue to try to bring about a revolutionary situation. Massive sabotage is indicated by the crude bombs they are manufacturing and teaching their recruits to manufacture in their training camps. This also means they are not getting any aid (military) from outside. We should allow them to gather strength but not such strength that we cannot overcome them.<br>
We continue to meet the students – a tedious time consuming effort to placate them. For what? They will come back with some more demands later on. But the play must go on.<br>
We must establish a mass base. Father Calles suggests that the women who are getting impatient should be organized. I agree.<br>
Then we must get the Armed Forces working properly. A dry run for Plan X must now be executed.<br>
I talked to Ambassador Byroade and told him I needed his continuous support before I started the drive against the communists now and later when the ammunition is exhausted. There is not a single round of ammunition for our 35 rocket launchers. But we have just received our ammunition reloader.<br>

3:00 AM<br>
The rioters have just dispersed at the corner of Recto and Legarda (3,000 of them) with six grenades of tear gas thrown at 1:00 AM. The gas is still in the air as there is no wind. The 150 men under Lacsina who had been at Gate 4 since about 7:00 PM waited for the rioters that forced their way into the U.S. Embassy compound, burned the guardhouse, destroyed the glass windows of the buildings and threw bottles full of gasoline in an attempt to burn it down. They also wrecked all the shops and restaurants in Plaza Fergusson, at A. Mabini, U.N. Avenue and the Luneta. Part of Hilton Hotel destroyed.<br>
Ambassador Byroade called me to seek help as the U.S. Embassy had only a few guards. I directed Usec. Manuel Collantes to order Mayor Villegas to order the anti-riot squad to break up the rioters.<br>
The massing of 3,000 near Malacañang was apparently a prelude to another attack on the palace.<br>
This was a show of the Lacsina, Bert Olalia and Kabataang Makabayan groups.<br>
But they are moving forward to the need for the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or martial law. Just a little bit more and we will have to.<br>
Met with the provincial governors and city mayors at [Camp] Aguinaldo for a briefing on the plan of the communists to take over the government and the need to organize strike forces of local municipal policemen which I authorized in March 1968. They want guns and ammo, funds and the lifting of public bidding in the purchase of police equipment – which I gave.<br>

Another violent demonstration like last night and according to our intelligence the next targets for sabotage are the public utilities and the big establishments, and I may have to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
Ambassador Byroade filed a strong protest for the vandalism, arson and destruction in the U.S. Embassy last night. I have asked Mayor Villegas to explain his inaction.<br>
Gen. Ordoñez of the Metrocom suffered head wounds last night.<br>
I asked Ernesto Rufino, Vicente Rufino and Carlos Palanca to withdraw advertisements from the Manila Times which was openly supporting revolution and the communist cause. They agreed to do so.<br>
I have convinced Maceda to stay in PACD and he still acted like a spoiled brat. I had to tell him that his employees were talking of his bringing women to the Executive Secretary’s office at night and that he was getting too arrogant.<br>
Gen. Rancudo has put up a SSB for direct communications between my office and the 5th Fighter Wing.<br>
The headline in the Bulletin has caused consternation among some senators as the secret orders if anything untoward happens to me has alarmed them of the military taking over. But this only if all the civilian government leaders are liquidated which is far-fetched.<br>

The report of the IMF and the solution acceptable to them has come in with Gov. Licaros. It is a multiple rate – a floating rate for all imports; all earnings of principal exports of copra, logs, sugar and copper concentrate to be surrendered to the Central Bank at the legal rate of ₱3.90 to the dollar except for 20% which will be allowed to be retained by the exporter and sold at the floating or free rate. Imports of luxuries and travel should be restricted. This will be an industrial development scheme. All the lesser exports will benefit and will be encouraged.<br>
It should be approved by our Monetary Board by now, effective tomorrow, Saturday, morning at 6:00 AM to coincide with the approval of the IMF Executive Board in Washington. We must watch prices.<br>
Met with Byroade and Jim Rafferty to offer my personal apologies. Those crazy Americans for a time thought that I had deflected the rallies from Malacañang to the U.S. Embassy to get them involved. Ridiculous!<br>
But Romulo is getting senile. That note of his in answer to the stiff protest of the Americans was off the beam. It speaks of there being valid ground for the attacks against the Americans and the Americans to ponder on the solution of the problems between the two countries. I have to replace Romulo soon. This is not the way to treat a wounded ally.<br>
More and more people are demanding sterner measures against the demonstrators. The Chamber of Filipino Retailers and small merchants demand protection for life and property.<br>
Met with the Moslem student leaders with their demands – specially Zamboanga and Basilan.<br>

The rally in the U.S. Embassy was quiet – there were more security men in the rally (in civilian clothes) than demonstrators. The demonstrators are losing their steam.<br>
Nori Pobaldor says the people are now in sympathy with me. Even Ex-Justice Alex Reyes says I have been making the right decisions – and that a little more destruction and vandalism and I can do anything.<br>

Spent practically the whole afternoon (4:00 PM) up to about 8:00 PM with the military, Gens. Yan, Espino, Ileto, Garcia, Tanabe, Sabalones, Ordoñez, Col. Ver and Diaz. Gov. Nepomuceno with Eric Mendoza who is a former jet pilot resigned because of hazing and helping in the location of Dante and Arthur Garcia whom he confirms he met after the claim that he (Garcia) was killed by Dante, were also here. Gov. Nepomuceno is disturbed by my statement to him that his bodyguards are Dante’s men. So he is helping through Mendoza in the campaign to locate Dante.<br>
We mapped out the plans in the event of the massive sabotage of the city and the public utilities. Transferred some of the armor to Central Luzon. They missed Dante by a few hours in Capas the other day.<br>
But we have five companies [of] reserves for the Metrocom which has 1,339 men – one company each from the major services and one from GHQ. Then there are two HDF in Malacañang, two in Camp Crame and one in [Fort] Bonifacio. The different brigades are forming up. In the event of an emergency, the PA can organize two more complete battalions with equipment in Fort Magsaysay and Cebu for the April training.<br>
Our unanimous assessment is that the subversives have no capability of mounting an attack of company proportion and probably will not but are capable of small unit harassment, sabotage and liquidation which capability should also be eradicated.<br>
Cocoy reports that the people have faith in my capability to solve the problems we face.<br>
Ablan Jr. claims Vic Villafranca whom he says is in his payroll will be the publisher of the Catholic newspaper for which a million dollars worth of printing machinery has been ordered. Villafranca is looking for an editor.<br>
Benny Toda of PAL is allegedly organizing an intelligence team under Col. Hernandez, former J-2, to research on the administration – in retaliation for my open skies policy.<br>
These rich people are back to their old tricks to protect their profits.<br>

The Lopezes are more and more vicious through their columnists. Ernesto Granada happily refers to me as snake-like. He probably knows he is suspected as a communist by me. And so does I.P. Soliongco.<br>
But the Lopez contributions to the radicals is their premium payments for insurance. They do not know that they would be the first to go if the communists take over.<br>
Adevoso and his co-conspirators have met again. They are still at it.<br>
Ninoy Aquino attacked the fertilizer plant project of the sugar planters in a privilege speech – a project that I have already ordered to be suspended.<br>
Villalon testified before the Joint Committee to the effect that the Liberals specially Osmeña funded and encouraged the demonstrations. There must be consternation among the Liberals.<br>
Looks like the demonstrations will continue and they may become more violent.<br>

Imelda went to the Tondo slums and relates how the children are eating only once a day and in some instances three times a week. So we have decided to convert Tondo into a model city – as a priority project.<br>

Fiscal Policy Committee with the Congressional leaders met to assess the monetary situation. The Senate President and Aytona was helpful. Speaker Laurel complained that the congressmen and he were not informed of the decision for a floating rate before approval. Puyat understood but as usual the Speaker did not understand the need for secrecy.<br>
Will start releasing funds for the provinces. Priority has been given to the Tondo project. I meet Enrique Zobel on the project next Friday afternoon.<br>
The trading this day on dollars quoted ₱5.70 to the dollar – much lower than we expected. The black market had reached ₱6.30. The persons who face dollar loan amortizations are complaining of the new policy for a floating rate as they will pay more in pesos but the exporters specially those not in the copra, sugar, logs and copper category are cheering it.<br>
Looks like we still have no funds in government. We should now have only one appropriation act to include even public works and capital expenditures.<br>

Met with Ex-Sen Domocio Alonto and asked him to help me prevent bloodshed in Moroland. He was reported having gone to Basilan and said that the country was in the grip of a revolution and the army 70% against the government. Of course he denied it and seemed obsessed with petty local politics.<br>
He was brought by Cong. Bert Sabido who kept repeating his requests for special favors – the Asst. Immigration Commissioner and allowances for the congressmen from savings in my office.<br>

The demonstrators went to Sunken Garden then proceeded to the U.S. Embassy where they were kept away from the buildings by the MPD and the Metrocom. The demonstrators have wrought destruction in Plaza Fergusson, threw a few Molotov cocktails and destroyed the pots along the islands in some streets. The last group was in Galicia Street. They numbered 200 and challenged the police to take them. Tear gas bombs were used again. Even the citizens in their houses were affected by the tear gas.<br>
Enriquito Zobel came to see me and told me that it was not he and his group who had organized to fight me but that it was Hans Menzi who had said that he was asked to resign as a senior aide because he had written me a frank memorandum about government weaknesses and anomalies. Looks like Hans cannot be trusted any longer.<br>
The congressmen from the North were here again waiting for the demonstrators. They had dinner and a movie.<br>

And the reaction of the public seems to be reacting favorably.<br>
Finished the problem of the Muslims. Salipada Pendatun says he will be responsible for Ex. Gov. Udtog Matalam the leader of the Muslim Independence Movement, who on Feb. 6, 1970 issued another manifesto against the government adopting the Ma-Mao and Kabataang Makabayan line. Salipada Pendatun insists there is no training ground for insurgents and that Udtog will consult him before he does anything serious. I have my doubts about his capability to hold Udtog but I am hoping for the best. I have asked him to bring Udtog’s son.<br>
Also settled the Sulu differences between Cong. Amin and Mayor Barby Abubakar of Jolo. It seems that Amin and Gov. Sangkula bring in policemen of the other towns fully armed into Jolo, causing tension. A barrio captain was killed by the policemen recently.

We will have to allow an increase in rates as the tire suppliers have increased prices by 17% and the oil people are meeting next Wednesday to increase theirs. I was able to hold the rates down in 1966. Today we will not be able to do this because of the floating rate.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1043" data-line-end="1047">Tuesday may be the crucial day. The KM’s yesterday agreed to hold a demonstration marching from the Quezon welcome arch to the U.S. Embassy passing by the Supreme Court. The demonstration bids well to be violent. Intelligence reports indicate that the radicals and communists may try and destroy the electric, water and telephone systems. They may try to burn or blast Congress and the Supreme Court. If they do I will suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and order the arrest of all the communist leaders once and for all. If this happens we have to be restrained and wise in the choice of persons to arrest.<br>
But this will set back the time table of the communists in the Philippines who have set their bid to take over the government this year or January 1971. It may be the better part of valor and wisdom to act now.<br>
Saw the film Julius Ceasar with John Gielgad, Paul Mason and Marlon Brando. Superb acting but it reminded me of the conspiracy going on now against me by all the envious men who have failed. Remind me to have my guards around me always. I have often wondered why Ceasar had no protection when he was assassinated.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1055" data-line-end="1060">I am quoted by the afternoon papers (Mirror and Evening News) as having charged the Jesuits of the Philippines of having incited revolution. I have said no such thing and have issued a denial. In the pause after the golf game last Saturday I merely said to Greg Datuin, Han Brown and Noring Andolong that we were looking into the participation or involvement of some of the school authorities including the Jesuits in the disorders and riots of the past several weeks.<br>
Father Ortiz has immediately issued a disclaimer and a charge of fascism and practically demanded an investigation. So I am asking the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Justice and the Immigration Commissioner to conduct an investigation specially of the Adenauer Fund which is supposed to be used for research for the constitutional convention. Father Sheffeld is pinpointed by Father Doherty as the one sent to approve the expenditure of the Adenauer Fund. He is now teaching German in Ateneo.<br>
But then the story might have been blown up by the radicals in media who would only be too glad to see the clergy embarrassed. And to split the moderates whom they may represent and the government.<br>
However some of the Jesuits are indeed preaching the need of violence like some of the faculty members in the public and private universities like UP, PCC….<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1069" data-line-end="1076">The People’s March was a flop. Only about 5,000 at the most joined. The march was supposed to get the support of the people in the streets and houses but it did not. Only a few of the spectators joined. It has ended in some Molotov cocktails thrown at the U.S. Embassy, three men caught with handguns at the Mini Golf, someone caught lobbing a Molotov cocktail in Congress, another bag of Molotov cocktails abandoned at the Finance building, about 30 arrested, 14 in the hospital and one serious with a cracked head.<br>
Father Ortiz’ abusive and arrogant reply to my supposed charge that the Jesuits were formenting the revolution (which I have denied and which is untrue) has brought out the image of the friar who brought about the Revolution of 1896. And the people are saying, the priest talks like a king and the king talks softly like a priest.<br>
Father Blanco was here and he has been included in the lecturers of the Imelda teach-ins in Malacanang.<br>
I still have my doubts about going into retreat in a Jesuit house. I still want to, however.<br>
Talked to Bibilo Prieto about Chino Roces. Bibilo was brought to Pangarap by Neling Nieto.<br>
The Northern Congressmen were in for dinner. Frisco San Juan feels that these series of demonstrations is debilitating to our economy and should be brought to a crisis and resolved. Yes it is like benign tertian malaria, the type hardest to cure. It should be resolved and cured soon. Frisco says he could provoke violence by the communists by introducing and starting the discussion of a bill making the anti-subversive act more strict.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1085" data-line-end="1091">The city is paralized because of the jeepney drivers strike. They claim that there is need for an increase in rates. So do the buses which are still plying their routes although they also claim 200 of their buses have been damaged (glass windows) by the stone-throwing driver-strikers. Mayor Villegas in the conference I called where the bus owners headed by Tony Herras, de Dios and Manzano and the jeepney drivers headed by their lawyer de Luna and Coms. Enrique Medina of the PSC and Edu of the LTC were present, suggested that the jeepneys be organized into one corporation or one working unit working the routes in Manila so that there will be no temptation for the police of Manila to collect tongs from jeepney drivers for preferred parking places and length of awaiting passengers, etc. Maj. Castillo of the MPD Traffic Division promised to take steps to meet the demands. Com. Medina will conduct in chambers meetings for the increase of rates of both buses and jeepneys.<br>
But as of now the transportation was running.<br>
Atty. de Luna claims the students offered financing to the jeepney drivers for them to join the Protest March yesterday. That must be the Kabataan Makabayan.<br>
Leoncio Co, Kabataan Makabayan Secretary General and his common-in-law wife Erlinda Taruc, niece of Peregrino Taruc, were captured in Bo. Talaga, Capas, Tarlac, last night.<br>
The congressmen (about 15) who visited me are all agreed the peaceful demonstrations are debilitating and the disorders must now be induced into a crisis so that the measures may be taken.<br>

Espino has come to show me a report that 25 Kabataang Makabayan leaders including Nilo Tayag, Crispin Aranda and Navarro met at No. 28 Libis Nadurata, Caloocan City behind the Iglesia Ni Cristo to plan the kidnapping of Bongbong anytime from March 15th to closing of school at the La Salle Greenhills area. Informant was in the meeting SI is of the KM-KPK (Kilusang Progresibong Kabataan under Brondon Cordero). This is the second plot in 1970.<br>
This is disturbing as the informant was present in the meeting. We are getting a confirmation and at the same time doubling Bongbong’s security. Tomorrow he is swimming at St. Martin’s and Imelda will inaugurate the swimming pool.<br>
Settled the Philippine National Railway demands as well as the DBP.<br>
Paco Reyes came to confirm that Manda Elizalde is just honor-grabbing in Tondo.<br>
Imelda had about 1,000 ladies in the Maharlika Hall to talk about Project Tulongan for Tondo. Father Blanco was one of the lecturers.<br>
I have appointed Leo Virata as chairman of the DBP. Maceda will take his place in the Dept. of Commerce and Industry. I will also use Leo to negotiate more loans abroad.<br>
If we can conditionally ratify the Phil-Japan Trade and Navigation Agreement we may be able to obtain a 200 million dollar loan from Japan. We should press our claim for the coconut excise tax collected by the U.S. during the Commonwealth and after the war to be used for the support of the Philippines in the amount of $250 million and settle for a loan instead.<br>
With this development on Bongbong I may have to hasten the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
But only if they persist upon the path of violence they have started.<br>
The danger that now confronts the matin must be eradicated for all time. Communism must be rooted out.<br>

Reforms yes, but perhaps the most urgent are the reforms inside us. Then the powers of the President in an emergency of this nature.<br>
Father Ortiz wishes to see me. So I have set a meeting here in Malacanang at 9:30 AM tomorrow. A little on the awkward side. But it is best that I set him at ease as he must be rather embarrassed since the statements he issued were rather arrogant.<br>
Met with VP Lopez whom I convinced to take Bong Tanco as Asst. Secretary for Agriculture and to agree to have a committee on oil concessions to be organized. He was with Piding Montelibano and Speaker Pro Tempore Jose Aldeguer. Piding says he has talked to IP. Soliongco to have the Chronicle toned down and to give them one week as the paper cannot suddenly turn around but must do so gradually. I wonder what happens to Ernesto Granada who has been unusually vicious.<br>
Kerima Polotan will write on the media and the communists.<br>
But we must soon put up a newspaper. The machinery that was donated to Imelda seems to be the right equipment for this project. We have to have a medium for our official positions.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1135" data-line-end="1147">As I study the situation of the nation I am more and more convinced that my solution to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and the detention of all communist activists as well as all those who have in any way helped in the cause of communism is the right and the only solution.<br>
So I have asked Sec. Ponce Enrile to prepare the applications for search warrants. He and Gen. Yan were in a conference with me at 4:00 PM with the major service commanders and their intelligence officers.<br>
I am now also convinced that the communists do not have popular support but are buying the participation of many of those who join the demonstration like the 8.000 who were in the last Protest March; but that the newspapers and the media specially the Manila Times and the Manila Chronicle are merely building it up with propaganda and beyond this it is nothing.<br>
Spoke before the UP Vanguard Fraternity on the powers of the President in an emergency and the fact that no group can mount a rebellion but that the subversives can engage in assassination, harassments and sabotage – even massive sabotage but that if this happened, I implied I might suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
Father Pacifico Ortiz, the Ateneo President, saw me at 4:00 AM and kept repeating he is praying for my success as President. I have my misgivings. He is a do-gooder, naive and woolly minded.<br>
He kept wanting to know what my reading was of the student demonstrations. I repeated to him my belief that these demonstrations strengthened the hand of a leader in government like me interested in reforms. But he did not seem to understand that communism as practiced differs from ideological communism; that communism has often discarded doctrine to attain its sole objective and that is power, so that communism may take the side of almost any popular movement to attain its ends; it could be the Moslem movement or the nationalist movement, or the jeepney drivers against mulcting police, or the teachers for higher salaries. He kept talking of social justice and the need to talk of it as he does in his radio commentaries. I informed him I am willing to talk of socialism, even communism but that it was the role of intellectuals too to be honest and present the various sides of every question.<br>
He kept wanting to know of the non-communist conspiracy. Of course I assured him of its existence but that no alien government was involved. And that we would reveal its details in good time.<br>
Communism feeds on such well-meaning but naive men who know nothing of realpolitik.<br>
As the member of Father Ortizes increase in our society, I must accelerate the various programs of reform and social justice (specially of economic development), attend to the media and the intellectuals to keep them on the side of liberal democracy, strengthen the military (I have ordered 2,500 M-16 rifles, 1,000 Beretta Brel. assault rifles and the U.S. govt. under MAP will give us 1,200 M-16’s by April for a total of 4,700 new automatic rifles); but more than this I must keep in mind the lesson learned from the history of communism that it is the timely and judicious use of authority and power when the communists are not yet organized enough to mount a guerrilla type massive attack which alone can save our republic from these communists and anarchists.<br>
Now that I have diagnosed the ailment if the demonstrations become violent this month, I will suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
We are actually organizing now the members of a counter-subversion center. Initially it is an office under the President’s Office, composed of Johnny Ponce Enrile, Melchor and Kits Tatad, but it will include all offices that has anything to do with counter-subversion.<br>

We set aside $2 million monthly for essentials beginning January, and this was at the old rate. And yet there seems to be scarcity. I have asked Sec. Leo Virata to get together with Greg Licaros to bring in essentials through Namarco which must be reactivated if necessary. Even in the provinces soap and sardines seem to be deficient. If this is not attended to, this could be a cause for disorders. And reports indicate the Chinese are hoarding. The communists could very well be in this too. This bears watching.<br>
Imelda brought the children and the Martel and Kokoy Romualdez families to Pagsanjan, up the rapids under the falls and down again. They apparently enjoyed the trip. Stayed at Malacanang to finish my work and think after reading the book The Strategy of Deception by Jeane J. Kirpatrick, a study in worldwide communist tactics. Her thesis is the alleged inevitable class struggle and victory of the proletarian class has been disproved by history and that Communists in practice are less doctrinaire than expedient. Theirs is realpolitik, less ideology. All they seek, in short is power, no matter what and the liberal democrats should meet them with the same objectivity and reality. The book disproves every single theory of Marx.<br>

Monday<br>
11:30 PM<br>
The first case of subversion under RA 1700 has been filed against Leoncio Co caught in Talaga, Capas, Tarlac in a raid of the military. He is the former Sec. Gen. of the Kabataang Makabayan against whom former Huks have testified that he is one of the high ranking officers of the new Communist Party.<br>
I have directed Sec. Ponce Enrile and Gen. Tanabe to get the witnesses against the Kabataang Makabayan leaders who are actually with the Communist Party and prepare the legal cases against them.<br>
We will now shift to the legal phase of the struggle until the communists use violence requiring the use of my extraordinary powers.<br>
At the same time we are now utilizing the propaganda facilities of the government. We will publish a Government Record or Report on our positions on issues that are being distorted by the Manila Times and the Manila Chronicle. This weekly will be distributed to all offices and schools. Johnny Tuvera will edit it.<br>
We are also using TV and radio, harnessing all our friendly commentators.<br>
I have asked O.D. Corpus to organize a think tank of constructive thinkers in the schools on subversion, counter-subversion and liberal democracy.<br>
The military operations in Tarlac are doing very well. Called up Gen. Tanabe to congratulate him and his boys. The nephew of Dante was killed with some others. Others were captured.<br>
I still feel that my greatest contribution to the country will still be saving it from communism. It would be easy to adopt palliatives and delay the confrontation with this deadly peril. But this would be the easy way out. After my term and within the decade or the next the nation would have to confront it anyway. And I would have been guilty of dereliction of duty if not cowardice for not facing up to it and rooting it out while I had the opportunity and the power.<br>
So I am decided that I must risk even the future of my family so as to save our freedoms and individual dignity. The issue has become this simple and brutal. It is a matter of survival. It is a matter of daring or not –on my part. And I decide to dare.<br>

The floating rate remains until we can determine by June the actual and true rate of the peso.<br>
Met the Anti-communist league which is for stern measures against the demonstrators and file criminal cases against them that will stick. Tony Roxas Chua wanted action against the Chinese Commercial News and the two brothers. Quintin Yuyitung had a case of deportation before but I rescinded the order to deport him.<br>

The KM boys, Barrican, Nelson Navarro and Nilo Tayag are in Bulacan and other provinces drumming up interest in their People’s Congress on the 17th of March. But the interest in the demonstrations is waning and the fever is dying down.<br>
So at the rate we are moving the old schedule of April or June may be kept and not any earlier. This will give us time to prepare even the evidences against the subversives.<br>
We are trying to scrounge for weapons specially M-16’s and ammunition in Vietnam. There are officers there who are willing to give them free to us even at the risk of violating regulations. And sad to state beggars we are and choosers we cannot be. So I have directed 500 M-16’s to be bought at cut rate prices if necessary. I would like at least a million rounds of 223 ammo to go with them.<br>
The ambushes of the Maoists are by M-16’s and M-79’s while most of our boys are still using M-I’s. Dante barely escaped by motorcycle the other day that his nephew who was killed was handcarrying some ammo to him. We have only about 400 M-16’s in the entire AFP.<br>
Have rested today. No exercise and golf because of the teeth extraction. Asked Joe Guevara to include the results of the survey in his column.<br>

Conferred with the people who have anything to do on prices. Appointed UnderSec. Bung Tanco as the Chairman of the committee to attend to prices. The plan includes importation by consumer cooperatives, tie-up of the agricultural or producer cooperatives and the consumer cooperatives directly or through the GMFTM. This may be the silver lining of this cloud of high prices and hoarding. The Phil. Wholesale Society has been given $200,000 to import essentials.<br>
The importers of prime commodities (canned goods) are willing to give their entire supply to the government for distribution. I give them 5% profit only. The offer was made by the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and big importers like Connell Bros.<br>

It is a case of private interest against the public good. So there is no choice. And I have ordered CAA Administrator Ablan to give cargo unloading and storage space to both PAN AM and Northwest as well as a fringer in the new terminal each, such to be constructed at their expense. Both promise to spend a million dollars each for the propagation of the tourist routes in the Philippines.<br>
Had lunch with Sen. Diokno, another of those who aspires to be President although he denies it. He told me the oil companies make profits on their crude oil purchases from their mother or affiliate companies setting their own price and on the cost of carriers, the latter about 15 to 20%. At his suggestion I asked Com. E. Medina of the PSC to see to it that after the increase of 5 centavos for jeepney fares, even if gasoline prices should go up as the crude oil inventories of the refineries is only up to April or May, there should be no further increases of passenger fare.<br>

Worked on prices again. More dollars for imports ($2 million monthly for essential canned goods and $1.8 for milk). Have ordered the GMFTM to initiate rolling stores and supply commissaries to be put up by public and private corporations. Recombined milk now being produced by factories working at half their capacity will be working a full capacity to fill up 1/2 of requirement – 150,000.<br>
But we must pass the export tax of 15% and 10% so that there will be no speculation on exports, there will be more dollars and there can be a reasonable estimate of costs which cannot be done with the present floating rate.<br>

The Tondo squatters demonstration for today did not go through as I convinced the leaders in Tondo and Manda and the priests with the Council that it is not necessary for we will give the land in the Tondo foreshore to the people who are entitled to it. Manda Elizalde claims he was the one who dissuaded the people and that even Father Murphy was agitating the people to demonstrate. The nuns with whom Imelda talked say this is not true as it was Father Murphy who was dissuading the Tondo people from demonstrating. It is a case where the people are caught between two men who want to get the honors of improving Tondo.<br>

I am now studying the proposal of Walter Leny our consultant on oil exploration to adopt an agency form of service contract where concessions remain with the government but are worked on by a service-contractor, all exploration at his expense, who upon discovery of oil acquires the right to buy the oil at 12 1/2 percent less than current price. This gives the government 70% of all the proceeds from the oil concession. This should solve the question of the 1974 termination of parity rights of the American oil companies.<br>
The House has started discussing the Export Tax bill known as the equalization tax. We hope to have it passed before Wednesday next week.

Apparently Sarmiento is lobbying so as to put plywood in a separate category as processed exports and thus since he is the biggest producer of plywood he will earn more profits. I insisted on the bill as it is – an across the board ten percent tax without exceptions. The distribution of the proceeds will be 40% infrastructure, 30% Development Fund and 30% to the General Fund.<br>

This included Chino Roces of Manila Times. He seemed conciliatory although he pointedly asked if I was not pressurizing the press because the movie advertisers led by his cousin Marcos Roces of Ideal Theater have notified him that they are cutting out advertising from the Times beginning tomorrow. Markitos had told me that they were doing so because the Manila Times was encouraging demonstrations which have driven away customers.<br>
Even Chino admitted that a revolution would fail but he claimed that I was underestimating the Communists and he maintained they were 20,000 strong in the Manila area alone and that they would try a revolt in 1970 and 1971 to early 1972 and if they failed then, they would fail completely.<br>
They agreed that any overt act of rebellion or sabotage would justify my suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Chino, claiming to know their plans, said that they plan to blast and burn the gasoline stations, 30 men to each station and destroy the public utilities including the Meralco, Nawasa and telephone. Even Heny Lopez and Andy Soriano asked why the leaders could not be arrested before they tried this and Chino hastened to add that the evidence would not support a case in court.<br>
Chino was apparently trying to frighten the others who asked me about my assessment. I assured them no revolt would not succeed but that the military felt that if there was going to be a military confrontation anyway, it should be triggered as soon as possible so that there may be less casualties.<br>
Andy Soriano said that one of his own men had suggested that San Miguel Brewery cut down on its advertising in Manila Times because of its leftist tendencies. This was to support my position that I had nothing whatsoever to do in suggesting the cut of advertisement although I did say that if this were so it would be a legitimate act against a paper that was becoming uncontrollably leftist. I then recounted how there had been a fight in the printing section of the Manila Times when Kabataang Makabayan changed the stories without the knowledge of the desk.<br>
I took the opportunity to tell them that the Manila Times was netting P400,000 a month and that it was true that we were checking on its income but that the routinary investigations of the business transactions of its shareholders was exactly that – routinary and of no concern of mine.<br>
They agreed to print an article under my by-line – A Primer on Communism. asked them to meet without me to agree on how they can help our democracy which they pledge to protect, then to come to see me with the plan.<br>

I come into retreat with my prayer that God give me the grace of strength and insight so that I may save my people from suffering; that I may not decide in anger what has to be decided but that I may not hesitate in doubts and irresolution when the decision has to be taken; that I may have the grace of patience and understanding.<br>
Played golf at the Mansion golf course 11:30-1:00 after arrival.<br>
PMA graduation exercises where I predicted that the military confrontation with communism is inevitable. (Incidentally Chino Roces headlines this with “Marcos warns of martial law” in the Manila Times). Last Saturday when I persisted in asking about the information that he has on communist plans, after stating that I underestimate the communist strength and that they would strike this year or next, he asked me to assign a good intelligence officer to go to Hongkong and get the information from Peking contacts giving the impression that the activities of the radicals in the Philippines are planned and orders given from Peking.<br>
Met with Joe and Ralph Friday night. Convinced Joe to update his diary and to then confirm his handwriting when a raid with search warrant seizes his diary with which he is confronted with the others who will also be searched and arrested simultaneously.<br>

Monday<br>
Free Time to 12:00 AM. Father Cruz, our retreat master, says our Christian commitment is to humanize our society. I have been saying this for a long time.<br>
It is both a Christian ideal and a pragmatic requirement of peace and development. For if society is not humanized, we fail to do what is right and worse, we lay the groundwork for the leftist radicals whose siren song will be the total incapability of the democratic society to help the brutalized underprivileged and the need for another ideology.<br>
But to do so requires management, more funds and currency stability as well as the harnessing of both private and public initiatives and resources.<br>
The “Tulungan” project in Tondo is an example. We will create new factories, give away the land to those who are hungry for land, build socialized housing, set up agro-industrial settlements, the green revolution, etc. But we need active executives and funds.<br>
I must now certify the bill on compulsary forced savings of ten percent of declared income which shall be invested in government bonds. Declared income is estimated at P2.7 billion so that this would mean forced savings of P270 million. The businessmen thru Piding Montelibano is willing to increase the rate to raise a total of<br>
P800 million from both the 10% export tax and the forced savings.<br>
The Congress (actually only the Senate as the House has approved both the Export Tax and Price Control Bills) has agreed upon my instance to meet on Holy Week (Monday to Wednesday) for the first time in history. They have consumed 48 days of their 100 days session and have passed only five bills on second reading.<br>

“Filters” and a corner of one’s self that is not “slave to your appetites” or subject to pressures and where one is moved for goodness only for goodness sake – not because of any reward or consideration<br>
The Lord supports you – be not afraid. This is the idea of telling the leader – go and expose yourself to the anger of the mob. Here I touch you and make you strong – go and do good. Bring my message and you shall succeed.<br>
The “filters” the good father speaks of are experiences that determine the manner with which one looks at things. One should not allow them to govern one’s decisions.<br>
“He who does not have the habit of reflection surrenders himself to panic” from the French philosopher.<br>
This is plain objectivity, scholarliness and freedom from passion and bias.<br>

Have hope. There is a natural goodness in everyone that will conquer evil. So how shall we respond to the invitation of God.<br>
85% of our people quietly works for our progress. The quiet anonymous government employee who spent what he called an overpayment to him, in seeds which he taught the underprivileged of Sapang Palay to plant and tend; the young men who have started small garlic farms and exported them; I can add those who are helping themselves by building irrigation dams on their own free labor – these are our people who believe in our democratic wav of life. But these 85% are now in a state of tension. So they seek guidance. And we must give it to them. For by creating new jobs, by increasing the income of the poor, by furnishing the social services, we remove the people from evil. Thus we do God’s bidding. Thus we fulfill our Christian commitment in our society that is under tension.<br>
The forces of the leftist radicals are equally dedicated. One Huk before he died said the principles of love for the poor and justice are but doctrines to you (talking to Father Cruz), to us they are our life.<br>
So our task needs the same courage that was needed in Bataan.<br>
The lecture of Father Cruz was so inspiring and timely that we invited the girls to come tomorrow to hear him but they have their own retreat under Fathers Tanseco and Nebrida. So we are tape recording our respective lectures instead for replay later on.<br>
Father Unson’s opening lecture was how to approach a retreat which is nothing but a new experience of God. I myself feel it is a renewal of my conversations with my Maker. He (Father Unson) sets three basic prerequisites. They are:<br>
N- earness – to God<br>
0-peness – to any message he may send<br>
W-onder at the pleasant result<br>

Manila<br>
8:50 AM<br>
March 24, 1970<br>
Tuesday<br>
Third day of retreat<br>
The meditations have been inspirational. “The Lord went into the darkness of the forest for his own test” was the theme of meditation this morning at 7:30 AM. I exercised and jogged inside the room for ten minutes (jogging); all in all about 15 minutes. It did not feel cold after that unlike yesterday morning when I did not exercise and felt chilly. Last night I was chilly and woke up at 4:30 AM.<br>
It is my feeling that Father Jose Cruz the retreat master must think I might be breaking down under the pressures of the crisis and so the inspirational talks. I must thank him for it. He even spoke of the Manila Times slanting the headline yesterday “Marcos warns of martial law” which of course I did not as borne out by the body of the<br>
story. Neither did Manila Chronicle help. It carried the headline “Marcos Threatens Martial Law” which was worse.<br>
“Goodness may not be immediately appreciated but this is the test. History is a capricious mistress and does not guarantee that even if she allows you a historical role she will reserve even but a little space for you. But it is for one’s satisfaction that one does what is right even if unpopular. One small mistake and all the brilliant achievements in the past are forgotten.” His example – Rizal.<br>
And I say we do what is right because of self-respect and integrity. Although a sense of history may propel us to do so, this is not the primary motivation, but pride in one’s integrity and in one’s self is a greater cause at times. Let me stand this suffering but Iet it be a suffering that will cure. Let it be the passion that will bring life.<br>
For the cries of the evil ones are heard over the land. And I must often bear the lash of their tongues in silence even if I know they are wrong.<br>
For time will bear me out. Of this I am sure as I am sure that my conscience tells me so.<br>
Today it is fashionable to be aligned against the establishment and I symbolize it. So all kinds of men pick up the cry of protest against what could be actual causes of grievance like crookedness and pettiness in public service.<br>
We listen to them knowing that the accusers are not any less guilty nor are they so nobly motivated. For there are indeed valid grounds for grievance and there are indeed rapacious, vicious and indolent men in the public service. And we must also rectify errors committed in the past.<br>
But the past is a heavy legacy of all these ills – 400 years and more of apathy, indolence, viciousness, pettiness and indifference. Four hundred years the spirit had died –and now suddenly we must resuscitate it. Phoenix-like it must spring alive from the ashes of our frustrations and our failures. This miracle is my task. Or at least its beginning and birth is.<br>
So I pray that I may be given the grace of inspiration, of wisdom, discrimination, dedication and courage to accomplish this task.<br>
And I am strengthened as I hear the Lord say: Fear not. I am with you. You shall not fail. For you bear my words in your mouth and my courage in your heart.<br>
Now I know why I could not order the shooting of the men who attacked Gate 4 of Malacañang on January 30th. They had attempted to burn the Medical Clinic, they had actually burned the fire truck with which the gate was rammed open as well as several vehicles and they had entered the compound where actually six were arrested.<br>
But there flashed through my mind’s eye all the killings and the butchery that I had known and I had participated in what was legitimate combat and I recoiled at the memory of what may be useless waste of life.<br>
The danger was there but it was not the danger that I had known in many a battle and paled into insignificance before the desperation of the last war and the underground.<br>
And most of the attackers were irresponsible children who could have been our children.<br>
I was never born to massacre babies.<br>
However our military and some of the advisers say if an armed conflict as you say is inevitable why not provoke it now when we would have to kill less than later when the communists will be stronger and we would have to kill more of our own people.<br>
Because it is still my hope that by legal action of the courts and restrained action against those engaged in actual violence we shall so weaken them and render them leaderless and debilitated they will never be able to mount an armed uprising.<br>
And also because we must stabilize the currency and propel the economy forward with such momentum that no matter what the jolts, the quakes and the shocks, later on such inertia will carry our country forward inexorably.<br>
Father Jose Cruz seems to have studied the problem of the militant youth although he claims that his views are merely those of an ordinary citizen.<br>
He starts with the warning that the problem may not be as insurmountable or as serious as most people may think. Only 350 armed Huks, a base of legal cadres (he calls them part time fighters at night) of a thousand and a half and some mass base. But he says 85% of our people are quiet workers for our progress although they receive only 40% of the benefits derived from our development while the 15% that owns the greater portion of our wealth receive the 60% of such growth fruits. He feels that we must not allow the communists (he calls them the leftists) to win the 85% and they have not. For he feels that the wisdom and discrimination of this 85% of our people sees through the slogans of the leftists, “imperialism, fascism, feudalism.”<br>
“In lieu of slogans we must give them issues and a dynamic ideology that is relevant to their lives. This dynamic Christian ideology that has to do with anything that is human. For it is through humanity that one approaches God.”<br>
And the greater number look askance at the violence and the disorder formented by the radicals for it destroys all that they have been working for. But this 85% is under tension and gropes for answers which we must furnish them. Thus the courageous dedicated leadership that will guide and reassure.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1449" data-line-end="1459">[Marginal notation: There was a fourth retreat master and she was not a priest. She was Imelda who was so enthused about the retreat, she talked intermittently about the subject of the meditations in the retreat.]<br>
Last night we had a second joint retreat with our retreat masters talking to us in succession. We had invited them to dinner at the Mansion then to another session. Father Cruz talked on filters and the Christian’s commitment in Philippine society. Father Tanseco followed on counsel for the married – the differences of outlook between the man and woman. The woman seeks to build a home so she is obsessed with a home life. But the man also wants a work life. The man is passionate and his love is in spurts but the woman is romantic, needs the refinements of preparation for the sexual act and has a love that is more consistent and prolonged and may be too possessive. Father Nebrida who is a Basque, a friend and colleague of the Black Pope and may become the next Black Pope spoke of the need to consider each human being as the nearest approach to God and therefore must be treated as such,<br>
The common note was hope and not despair, life and not death and the triumph of goodness in man over evil – this struggle being the most agonizing of conflicts.<br>
Blas Ople warns of a plot to take over the government by some retirees being openly spoken of in media circles. He says that Thursday or Friday students armed by the Huks or the CIA will attack the police and Metrocom, place me under House arrest in Baguio, the first division to neutralize any loyal troops of the AFP. So I sent Gen. Zagala to take over command of the 1st Infantry Division, grounded Col. Carreon, deputy commander and an S. Osmena man, as well as Commodore Cabal and Col. Irlanda, Commander and Deputy of the SOWESCOM as well as Col. Dizon, CO of the 20th BCT, and Capt. Nangkil, the S-2 of the 10th BCT stationed in Central Luzon.<br>
Gen. Zagala has taken back command of the Tabak Division, transferred command of the Pasig Task Force to Col. Jose, Deputy Commander of PHILCAG. The Deputy Commander of Gen. Rancudo, CG of the 5th Fighter Wing (jet fighters), Col. Bauzon was replaced by Col Bueno.<br>
Class ’44 of PMA will be retired except for some who are vouched for by the loyal commanders.<br>
So everything is under control. But I guess that this is a false alarm. However as Gen. Espino, Vice Chief of Staff who was here on the way to inspect Batanes, says, there is nothing lost in precaution. He commands the reserves of nine batallions in the contingency plan.<br>
Chino Roces saw Sec. Alex Melchor last night and says he is willing to sell the Manila Times. He is probably feeling the pressure and may think that he is going to be arrested next. I do not believe him but we will play along. I am sending Ronnie Velasco, who has suggested to Bebeng Roces to put up an anti-communist newspaper with the Manila Times outlets, to see Don Ramon Roces if the stockholders (Ramon Roces actually organized the Manila Times after the war and gave shares free to the Roces family) will sell out. Then I meet Chino Saturday here in Baguio.<br>
I go to Ilocos Norte, lunch at Poro Point and return to Baguio tomorrow if I do not go to Manila for lunch.<br>

Talked to Moon Park of Phil-Asia on the possibility of his extending financing for the establishment of Trading Centers for tobacco in the north, grading the tobacco (Virginia) for export and thus developing our export industry, cutting out the anomalies in the trading of Virginia tobacco specially in the grading, the ultimate withdrawal of subsidy to tobacco (in three years I hope) as well as his company financing the purchases of Virginia tobacco by PVTA. We also took up the development of a railroad in Mindanao and the development of West Irian which attracts me as it is completely raw land we could attend to when I retire.<br>
Looks like Blas Ople’s story of a coup d’etat is false. Everything is quiet.<br>
I went to Ilocos Norte by plane with Gen. Singson of the Air Force, Federico Ablan, Jr., CAA Administrator and my usual party. Arrived at 8:45 AM and left at 11:45 AM for San Fernando, La Union as I did not need to go to Manila and I could not go to the Cagayan Valley as they are not there. Took lunch in Poro Point. Joe Aspiras served us abuus (bee’s eggs) and ararusip, kibitzed on Bongbong and the boys practicing swimming, took a nap after meeting with the political leaders and after a news interview returned to Baguio by car at 4:30 PM to arrive 6:00 PM.<br>
Lt. Col. Lapena went on a dry run to Banawe and does not recommend my using the helicopter from Baguio to Banawe but instead from Bagabag to Banawe which is only a twenty minute ride.<br>

Played golf at our Mansion Golf Course which I had previously christened the Caniao Golf Course. I was swaying and my timing was off but I did birdie the monstrous dogleg, par 5 No. 6. To reach the opening of the dogleg for we could not cut too many trees, one must make a 280-290 yard drive. The greens are lush but we cannot cut the grass too short as there is lack of water and some of them are shaded.<br>
We have about finished the conference room or building extensions. There are seven rooms on each wing, the large conference room and if a second floor should be put, it would be more comfortable than the guest house. We are preparing this for the Seato Military Advisers Conference on April 2-3. The Military Advisers have breakfast with me on April 4th at Malacanang at 7:30 AM.<br>

The day started with Chino Roces and Enriquito Zobel. Chino came to say that he was for the success of my administration and that his paper would help. He also pumped me for information. “Are you decided to arrest them?” he inquired. I said yes but I must settle the economic questions of the stability of the currency, the legislative program and the social welfare program first. And there must be an overt act. Enriquito said “But not too late, Mr. President.” Not much advance from the last meeting.<br>
I ordered the final draft of the contract for the private buyers to put up the P100 million for the Trading Centers of Virginia tobacco, to change the classifiers and graders with those coming from the buyers, and to convert the liability that is Virginia tobacco now into an asset by making it an export product. Had Moreno, Mapa and Congs. Crisologo and Valdez in the conference. Told Sen. Pres. Puyat about it.<br>
Ordered Nawasa not to increase the rates of water and sewage until there was a reorganization. Asked Sec. Makasiar, Sec. Ople and Govt. Corporate Counsel to study the limits of the Collective Bargaining Agreement on changes and assignments of personnel.<br>
Had lunch with one half of the jet fighter pilots of the 5th Fighter Wing under Gen. Rancudo. They looked like the better type of officers.<br>

The Manila Chronicle has come out this Sunday with a vicious front page editorial on Martial Law which included a cartoon of the country tied up captive with all the rats representing the ills of the country and the sword of Damocles Martial Law over his head.<br>
It sounded like an Ernie Granada or IP Soliongco editorial. They must be agitated by the fear of arrest if I suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1589" data-line-end="1600">Finished golf at 10:00 PM as I had to tape an interview by MOPC with Max Soliven as a moderator and Doroy Valencia, John Nance and Emil Jurado as interrogators up to 7:30 PM. Poor Ronnie Velasco waited since 5:00 PM to play with me.<br>
Came from Tuguegarao where I spent the whole morning. Left at 8:00 AM and arrived at the NAB at 2:15 after a one hour flight. The reception was tumultuous and the people scratched my hands in an effort to shake hands with me. Felt like the campaign all over again but of course that was the north.<br>
I explained the need to spend the new special fund of P10 million (P3.5 m of which goes to Cagayan Valley as Ex-Sen. Ganzon had insisted in dividing the lump sum with the Visayas and Mindanao which do not produce tobacco – Ganzon had grown overbearing and erascible and so lost in the last elections) properly so we can increase our exports of native tobacco as we are converting Virginia tobacco into an export crop.<br>
We must also put up a cigar-rolling factory in the Cagayan Valley. The Valley is rich and it has the longest cement road and the biggest number of long bridges in the Philippines.<br>
I signed the Price Control Bill into law at 3:00 PM.<br>
But we must pass the export tax bill so as to stabilize the currency and the prices. Joe Roy and Diokno are against it so I must confer with them tomorrow. Wonder what their game is.<br>
Imelda is at the Cultural Center attending the presentation of the Warsaw Philharmonic and giving them a reception afterwards. She laughingly said that she will be with the leftists tonight.<br>
I have found a place where Bongbong can go hunting. This is the hacienda of Luis Gonzales, one half of which has been bought by Cong. David Puzon. There is a lake full of ducks and to the east he can hunt deer and wild pig on a drive blind. Incidentally the Gonzales Hacienda of 3,000 hectares is near the Madrigal hacienda which are both at Luwain, Kalinga-Apayao. We pass it by helicopter on the way from Isabela to Tabuk. But Bongbong will have to watch out for malaria.<br>
Joe Maristela says it may be difficult for him to testify against the group of Terry Adevoso. He suggests that they be handled in a more peaceful way so that they may not continue with their plan of assassination.<br>
VPres. Lopez has just rejected my offer for him to be chairman of the Price Control Council. This seems to jibe with the boast of the plotters that they are in touch with him and the editorials of the Chronicle have given substance to my fears that the Lopezes are in on the plot to assassinate me.<br>

Have just finished a charming dinner for Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands; he pilots his own plane and is head of the World Wildlife Conservation of which Gen. Lindbergh is a director.<br>
Have finished my paper work including the appointment of Ex-Sec. Manuel Lim as Chairman of the Price Control Council in lieu of VPres. Lopez who has rejected it because he may not have time for it. I can start tomorrow after the breakfast for the Military Advisers to Seato and a courtesy call of the President of Pepsi Cola, Mr. Kendall. I go to Ozamis City where I have Imelda to go by helicopter to Mahayag, Zamboanga del Sur to inaugurate a 10,000 hectare irrigation system built on a self-help basis at a cost to government of only P40,000; back to Ozamis to close the PRISSA; go to Iligan by helicopter to Iligan City to meet the religious and political leaders then by boat to Surigao overnight; open the Interscholastic meet, then by boat overnight to Cagayan de Oro, inaugurate the extended airfield, then proceed to Zurallah and by helicopter the Lake Sebu area of the Tagabilis and the Obos, then after lunch and conference to General Santos by plane to sleep at Dole Phil.<br>
And on Monday the Pinagbuklod Ng Manggagawang Filipino decided to stay away from their jobs to pray for the increase of the minimum wage. The papers of course call it a strike.<br>
Father Blanco in a visit to Alex Melchor alleged that the laborers and students are planning to blast the fuel tanks of the oil companies if the gasoline price is increased (which it has already).<br>
I feel that this particular Jesuit is trying to earn a reputation as a violent radical -just for the notoriety and the publicity.<br>
But if there is any massive sabotage I will have to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>

Actually I write this on April 5 at 9:00 AM off the coast of Surigao, Surigao on board the President 777 while we are waiting for the people to assemble at the wharf for the reception. I siept without writing my daily notes as I was fatigued. I had not slept (practically) the night before and had been running from the 7:30 AM breakfast with the Military Advisers of Seato including our old friends Admiral McCain who commanded one of the submarines that supplied us in the guerilla movement during the war while the Japanese occupied the Philippines and Air Marshall and Mr. Dawee of Thailand. Met with Mr. Kendall of Pepsi Cola bought by Cong. Bert Sabido and father. He is close to Pres. Nixon so I conveyed through him the message that they should not commit the same mistake they committed in Korea – that is the failure to arm and train indigenous troops while there was time. The U.S. would come to protect their bases if the communists took over so why not just make the AFP stronger now.<br>
The Fokker Friendship is out of commission because of lack of some spare parts which have to be flown from Amsterdam. So I used the PNB King Air and Imelda used a PAL chartered AVRO.<br>
Helicoptered against a 40 knot wind (in 25 minutes) to Mahayag for the inauguration of the Salug Valley Irrigation Dam for 11,000 hectares. Then back to heli to Molave (both at Zamboanga de Sur) and participated in the fiesta. Returned to Ozamis City to close the PRISSA (Private Schools Athletic Association national competition College and High Schools) then by boat to Iligan to exhort the Ulamalis religion.<br>

Am writing this at 11:20 PM, April 7th, as we have been rather busy.<br>
Overnight from Surigao, Surigao which we left at about 8:00 PM to arrive at Cagayan de Oro at about 8:00 AM on the 6th. Inaugurated the only two-kilometer cemented airfield in Mindanao. Laoag is not cemented and is only presently 1,800 meters only but I am extending it. I could see Sen. Pelaez titillated when I said that of the triumvirate (Macapagal, Pelaez, Marcos) of bar topnatchers in the Congress of 1949 only Pelaez has not become President.<br>
Flew by Fokker, Imelda using an Avro chartered from PAL to Zurallah in Allah Valley where we had lunch after a tumultuous welcome of all the mayors of Cotabato del Sur, Gov. Morales and Cong. Chiongbian. Had Ali Dimaporo and Floring Crisologo with us. Flew by Huey Helicopters at 1:30 PM to Bo. Comatok (a 15 minute flight including flying around) where the PANAMIN project is for the Tagabili, Obo or Manobo and the Blaan’s or Bilaans. I proclaimed a 5,000 hectare reservation for them and without prejudice to existing rights of grazing land leases and homesteaders.<br>
Then flew at 4:00 PM to the Lake Sebu area where there has been some bloodshed and burning of villages because of land conflicts.<br>
At 5:00 helicoptered to Dole Phil. where we are now staying with the Velascos. Ronnie who met us in Zurallah is President of Dole Phil.<br>
Had time for four holes of golf, two with the aid of a flashlight. Dave Gores, the plantation superintendent, was my caddy. South Cotabato Press &amp; Radio Interview. Slept at 12:00. Woke up 9:50.<br>

Lazy day. Woke up at 9:00 AM. Golf at 10:00 to 12:00 AM. Lunch at 12:45 and then we heard the news of the earthquake. Intensity 7 at Manila, 5 in Laoag and Legaspi, 4 at Calapan and 3 at Catarman. Epicenter of this tectonic earthquake 197 kms. North East of Quezon City. Pedro Guevarra School Annex collapsed. It is now the center of relief operations. 51st Eng. Brigade, PC, PB and Red Cross there. 4 teachers recovered. one dead. 4 others in the city may be dead.<br>
International and MIA facilities for air navigation damaged. Temporary systems established.<br>
Alex Melchor and Johnny Ponce Enrile apparently taking care of things very well.<br>
Imelda cooked crab in banana leaves with garlic and ginger for dinner.<br>
Talked to the children by the Dole wireless system through a phone patch at 2:00 PM and again at about 8:30 PM. Irene was more concerned about Pugger their Pekinese than about anything else. They were evacuated to Pangarap. Only one 10 inch vase Sang de berg of Imelda at the reception hall crashed. Parts of the chandeliers fell and Malacanang has some more cracks.<br>
Dinner and reminiscences of criminal practice and Yamashita’s treasure and the war up to 11:00 PM with Ronnie and Linda and Paul and Phyllis Sink.<br>

Went to bed at 12:30 last night and woke up at 5:30 AM. Heli to the coffee plantation at the knoll which is about 3,000 feet less high. The housing site of Dolephil is 2,100 feet above sea level. Unusually warm but a continuing 15 knot breeze from the east.<br>
Took off for Davao at 7:30 AM. Davao City at 8:00 AM. No hostile demonstrators. To the conference of bishops where Mons. Gonzaga and Velasco were present. Then to the inauguration of two city cemented streets. People very enthusiastically waving to us and shaking hands, running out of their homes to see us.<br>
Took off for Manila at 9:30 AM. Uneventful trip but ceiling high. Estimated 15,000 feet. Landed at 11:50 AM. Inspected the temporary tower (navigational lent by the 13th Air Force as our MIA tower was knocked out by the earthquake). Then to the Pedro Guevara School that collapsed. Built by the city and inaugurated only last February. Faulty construction – powdery cement. Covered by television-radio. Went to the top of the debris with the volunteer workers.<br>
Bongbong says he never knew he could run so fast downstairs. He first fell flat on the floor of his room and then ran out. So with Irene but she returned to pick up Pugger the Pekinese who was sour because he had been awakened.<br>

Just played golf with Bobby and massage. Then a briefing by Col. Ver on the Adevoso plot on a coup d’etat. All team leaders for the kidnapping or assassination of Maceda, Raval, Ablan, Crisologo identified. But that for me as yet remains unknown to our asset Col. Jose Maristela. Adevoso may be replaced by Gen. Sanchez as the leader of the operation. And there will be a big nation-wide rally on June 19th where they will have killer, looter and stealer as well as arson groups. Loot will be distributed to the squatters in Tondo.<br>
But what surprised our asset was that Jimmy Propongco brought him to the VIP Bldg. where the others – Daza, Sanchez, etc. except Adevoso were and in a few minutes Osmeña came into the room and asked to be briefed on the progress of the respective conspirators. Osmeña is quoted as saying that Byroade is sympathetic. Salonga is supposed to be in the know.<br>
This places a new and dangerous aspect to the plot. Because for the first time, Osmeña is confirmed as the mastermind and the financier of the plot. We must know the men assigned to assassinate me. And the other participants of the plot. But we must be quiet until it is necessary to move.<br>
Went to Bataan by 777 after receiving the UN Secretary General at 7:00 A.M. He stays with us as our official guest. Returned at 1:00 PM to arrive at 4:30 PM.<br>

Have just met with Minister Adam Malik of Indonesia after the state dinner for US Sec. Gen. U Thant. Foreign Minister Rajaratman of Singapore also here.<br>
Warned him of Osmeña and his partner Larry Truckman who has a lurid past of gun running and selling in South America.<br>
Postponed trip of Pres. Suharto to the Philippines because of the Maoist plot to embarrass him and me from May to latter part of this year.<br>
Discussed the Cambodian question. He feels the ICC should be brought and backed to drive away the Vietcongs so that Cambodia can be neutral.<br>
U Thant was able to address the joint session of Congress where he was cheered not only by the members but by the picketers for a higher minimum wage.<br>
But he may be embarrassed in the UP as 200 graduates have anticipated their desire to stand up and leave if he addresses the graduation. So there will be a private ceremony in the President’s office of the UP<br>
We certainly have come down to a new low in international stature.<br>
And we will have to do something about this when I have finished with the economic questions of Circular 289, the export tax and minimum wage.<br>
Met with Joe Maristela whom I must introduce to Johnny so we can prepare the legal aspects of the case of plotting a coup d’etat. We will infiltrate the plotters with our men from the PGB or PS. And prepare alternative plans.<br>

Have just finished the state dinner for the One Asia Assembly delegates. Pleasant evening.<br>
Spoke before them this morning on the New Directions for Asia; that “unless by One Asia we mean a Communist Asia, exported war is a reality. And for some time to come, exported war will be the most awesome obstacle to unity in Asia.” “We must create a situation in Asia where the condemnable acts of any superpower will be met by such a general censure by the small nations that the superpowers cannot disregard it.”… “How can you computerize the Asian spirit and place the Asian soul on the scales of the<br>
material world?”<br>
Then met the jeepney drivers headed by Pelagio Villegas and Atty. Lazaro. I will induct their officers on Monday before the conferences on the minimum wage of the congressional, industrial and labor leaders. They still insist on the lowering of the gasoline prices. But I have ordered the Public Service Commission to cancel the certificates of public convenience of jeepney operators who increase their boundary limits thus depriving the jeepney drivers of their share in the increase in rates.<br>
Have started issuing titles to the slum dwellers of the Tondo foreshore land. Settled their conflicts, rerouted the Roxas Boulevard so as not to go through the mass of houses; and directed that the large tracts of land not needed by the such recipients like Don Bosco. The radicals cannot exploit the Tondo slums now. Manglapus is however trying to incite a demonstration which I have been able to prevent.<br>

An earthquake of Intensity V has forced us to transfer quarters temporarily to Pangarap, our one strong clubhouse or resthouse at the Malacañang Park at the other side of the Pasig. Papers in possession of the Romualdezes indicate that Malacañang Park used to belong to the Romualdezes.<br>
Have just introduced Sec. Juan Ponce Enrile to Ex-Col. Jose Maristela in the Osmeña-Adevoso plot to assassinate me and take over the government. Cut-off will be Eric Nubla between them and with Col. Ver.<br>
We have just apprehended another of Commander Dante’s killers in the suburbs. But the priests and nuns keep inciting the people of Tondo to demonstrate and the jeepney drivers to strike. Some nuns have even coerced the jeepney drivers threatening bodily harm, according to Atty. Lazaro and Pelagio Villegas, their leaders. A little unbelievable but they swear it is true as now the priests and nuns are using goons. Where has our pious church come to!<br>
I have ordered Sec. O.D. Corpus of Education to terminate classes after Tuesday because of the possible tragedies that may come out of a recurrence of earthquakes with the children in such school buildings like Pedro Guevara School that collapsed. The roof of the Manila High School collapsed today.<br>
Imelda cooked some ginataan na langka and ginataan na manok and curry for dinner. We asked Father Bautista the PG chaplain, Sec. Ponce Enrile and Neling Nieto to stay for dinner.<br>
The children seem to like it better in this small house – better than the palace anyway.<br>
If the Osmeña-Adevoso plot (although now Adevoso who is supposed to have said that I seem to be doing alright and “perhaps we should join him” meaning me, according to Ex-Col. Jose Maristela, is being pushed out of leadership by Ex-Gen. George Sanchez) continues, I may be compelled to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Their plan apparently is to burn Manila on Independence Day, loot and kill in a big (100,000 according to Osmeña) demonstration on Independence Day, June 12, 1970. Although according to Joe Maristela there was a disagreement between Col. Faustino David (Ex-Nica) and Osmeña as to the date, Osmeña saying it was supposed to be on July and David correcting him saying it was supposed to be June.<br>
There were also more Lyceum students among the student demonstrators in UP than UP students, on graduation day (yesterday when U Thant was supposed to address them).<br>
Our people are beginning to feel restive and suggestions keep pouring in that we should do something about communism in the U.P.<br>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1746" data-line-end="1747">A full-blown communist plot with various liquidation squads active in Central Luzon and Manila and backed by an organized dedicated armed force.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1747" data-line-end="1755">The plot in the planning stage to take over the government by Osmeña. This includes the taking alive of Sec. Maceda and Ex-Gen. Raval supposedly to testify in and substantiate the protest of Osmeña after I have been assassinated with Congressman Ablan (Col. Faustino David assigned as team leader), Congressman Crisologo (assigned is Jimmy Piopongco now on a mission to the U.S. either to get financial or armament backing), Cong. Durano (Mayor Bores, Bacals, Nic Tumulak and brother assigned), Cong. Alberto (Col. Juan Daza assigned), Congressman Ali Dimaporo (Rascid Lucman assigned) and others.<br>
In the last meeting at the VIP office of Osmeña where he was briefed, he spoke of a plan to burn Manila on June or July, Terry Adevoso was absent.<br>
This group has put up a training ground in Samar and Iloilo for 300 men each. They claim to have 12,000 firearms not yet smuggled into the country.<br>
They are apparently in touch with the communists as in the establishment of the training grounds they have been using and dropping the name of Commander Dante freely. And they have been seen in touch with both communist and student activists.<br>
But as Adevoso explained in one of their meetings, they must take over the government ahead of the communists or if later they must be able to dislodge such communists without too much trouble.<br>
They have done away with the original plan of a bloody revolution as messy in favor of a neat semi-legal coup d’etat.<br>
Col. Jose Maristela who has sat in all their meetings confirm these facts. So does de Leon, our asset who has infiltrated the Samar Training Camp and Father Laua, the rector of San Agustin University (Iloilo) and his men, as well as Valdellon who insists the Liberal leaders including Salonga and Lucman plotted in the house of Gerry Roxas sometime on February 5, 1970.<br>
Now comes the plan to burn Manila in a big demonstration in June or July,</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1755" data-line-end="1766">The Manglapus-clerico plot to bring about a revolutionary situation which will force the government to capitulate to his Christian Socialist Movement in the coming elections for the Constitutional Convention and in the subsequent national elections of 1973.<br>
Any kind of deterioration of the economy or erosion of the people’s faith in the government and its leaders is supposed to help their plan. So they finance, support and encourage demonstrations, strikes, violence, anarchy and even assassination.<br>
It is their feeling that the Maoists and radicals or even the communists like Dante and Sumulong are paving the way for them.<br>
Some well-to-do families and oligarchs like the Lopezes and the Zobels may be partially financing them as insurance or for any of their known or unknown reasons.<br>
The various plotters and groups are trying to use each other for their own selfish purposes resulting in a kaleidoscope of plot and counter-plot that defied clarification but is just now beginning to fuse into one grand design.<br>
When the government takes action, it must be able to liquidate not only one or several of the plots but ALL of them with one clean blow.<br>
For the danger or crisis may not come during my administration but may explode in the face of a newly-inducted and therefore disoriented and unprepared neophyte in the Presidency who may stampede and run leaving our country and people to their devices. Then there will be anarchy. And the Armed Forces would take over.<br>
Before the government moves on this front, it must settle the problems in the economic front, in the meantime reorienting its intelligence organization and activities. will now put up an integrated intelligence set-up.<br>
It must exert the utmost pressure on the armed elements in Central Luzon preventing them from supporting the activities of the plotters in Manila. The communists (Maoists and Traditionalists) should be encouraged to fight each other. Sumulong should be further motivated to go after Dante and his men.<br>
We must sow dissension among the activists.<br>
We must move faster on reforms – economic, social and political – specially.</li>

Besa Shoes asking for loans because of the fire.<br>
Mayor, VM and Councilors of Parang, Cotabato the center of smuggling in Southern Mindanao. The Bongo Island Sowescom detachment is not doing its job.<br>
Met Gen. Ne Ulin, Chairman of the Revolutionary Council of Burma since 1962. It is rumored that a coup d’etat is being executed against him tomorrow.<br>
He must be confident though, to leave Burma with Mrs. Ne Ulin for Tokyo, Osaka and London – Osaka for Burma National Day on the 17th at Expo ’70 and London for medical treatment.<br>
The general was garrulous but nervous. He made a running account of everything with little prodding on my part. He impresses me as a forceful man – even rough and ruthless. He speaks easily of killing. Trained by the Japanese in Hainan Island but he wanted to be a doctor.<br>
He was a student leader against the British.<br>
He has controlled insurgency in Burma. There are two groups of insurgents, according to him – the communist (Maoist and Russian oriented) and those organized by the British and the Americans.<br>
He has nine children, six by his first wife and three by his previous wife.<br>
He was close to the Chinese leaders, Chou En Lai, Lao Tsi, until the 1967 Chinese students killing of the Burmese.<br>
Last December the students also had a demonstration in Rangoon. He wanted to know their leaders, so he allowed it, then arrested the leaders. Since then there have been no demonstrations.<br>
In 1948 when Burma acquired independence, the Burmese government were in control only of Rangoon and one or two big towns without any link by land. Communication only by air, but they reduced the communist stronghold village by village.<br>
The situation in Laos and Cambodia is uncertain. Sihanouk may still make a comeback with the help of the communist troops thereat, but that would not be good implying that Sihanouk would be captive.<br>
The big powers always want to come back to a position of dominance. Mrs. Ne Win interjected during the conversation that the Burmese government is a dictatorship and Imelda hastily referred to the many suggestions that this was best for a developing country.<br>
Laos. Cambodia and Vietnam are all small, weak and unstable countries.<br>
Ne Ulin is tall for an Asian, about 5 feet ten inches, balding and seems filled with nervous energy. He has Chinese features but is browner than yellow. He did not finish his medical course although he says he wanted to be a doctor. He was taken by the Japanese for military training and ended up as Chief of Staff of the Burmese Army. He is about sixty years old<br>
All the Manila Times columnists attacked my speech before the One Asia Assembly. Ernesto Granada of the Chronicle as usual was vicious calling it a comic relief. Even Joe Guevara and Doroy Valencia as well as J.V. Cruz criticized it. Joe Guevara said that my foreign policy speeches are below the par of my domestic speeches which are below par. I hope he plays golf some time so he may know what sub par means.<br>
But my impression is that none of them have bothered to read my speech. The Manila Times columnists apparently were guided by the hand of Chino Roces, their publisher. And the Chronicle as well as its prime columnist Granada moved by a general principle of hatred.<br>

a. Revealing the letters of Dante and Sumulong against each other and the acts of one band against the other.<br>
The same among the activists<br>
a. Jose Maria Sison against Dante<br>
b. Nilo Tayag plotting against Dante<br>

I have just come from Rizal Stadium where I opened the Asian Football Youth Tournament. There are 16 competing teams and the Tunku Abdul Raman cup is at stake. Our team tied with Laos in a fast paced game that saw the Laotians ahead at 2-1 at 4 minutes to the end of the last half then a Phil. goal in two minutes and on to a tie.<br>
There was an Intensity IV earthquake on the second game of Korea vs. Thailand, the two roughest teams in the tournament as Bongbong calls them. Korea won on a disqualification of the team for alleged Thai malicious fouls.<br>
Signed the proclamation on the Magalang Agricultural Community Development project this morning. It sets aside 756 hectares for development by the Filipinas Foundation of Enrique Zobel.<br>
Incidentally, he (Enrique) told me that Maceda when removed as Executive Secretary handed over to Ninoy Aquino two duffel bags of documents – according to Ninoy. Since Ninoy is a “congenital liar” this is untrue. And what has Maceda or anyone to reveal. But Ninoy claims he has photostats but that Ablan Junior got back the duffel bags when Maceda was appointed Commerce Secretary – Enriquito implying that I was blackmailed into it which is a lot of hogwash as usual from Ninoy. But I can see that the Zobels do not like Maceda. Or more accurately, Ninoy Aquino is worried I am building up Maceda for President which is of course not true.<br>

I have the highest hopes for the Magalang Project to raise the standard of living of the peasants in Central Luzon. I will build infrastructures for them with the veterans of PHILCAG. I will protect them with the Home Defense Forces. This is the secret to peace and order in Central Luzon – the villagers defending their own homes. I understand from Liberal Congressman-elect Sanga of the 2nd district of Pampanga, 3/4 of the legal cadres in Pampanga have been driven away by the HDF units organizing alone. The villagers know who the communists are.<br>
I shall spread this idea all over the Philippines and into the cities by encouraging first the registration of guns then the training of the men who carry or possess them. Then defense for each block or building in a city can be built up by the Week-End Soldier concept.<br>
Tomorrow Imelda starts her Tulungan project in Tondo. It is principally jobs, housing, food and medicines. I have given the people the land titles. But we make them work for these and help themselves. This is also a pilot project for slums and depressed areas.<br>
Just a little hope for those in despair and we have the communists running.<br>
But yesterday I stood firm on the jeepney drivers’ strike and ordered the Metrocom to arrest any of the drivers violating the law and the strikers backed down. There was no violence and no disruption of transportation.<br>
Today I had lunch with Ka Erdie Manalo after I settled the SIS demonstrations. Received plenty of intelligence from the most unlikely sources.<br>

The Kabataang Makabayan has gone to the provinces to “learn from the people” actually teach-ins. In Arayat, the police (municipal) arrested the UP Collegian editor and others for showing a Red Chinese film without permit. This group issued a statement through the media that they were brought to Camp Olivas and beaten up. The truth is they were in the custody of the Arayat police all the time and were not touched at all.<br>
There should be immediate counter-action by the local leaders against these communist teach-ins.<br>
Let us locate some anti-communist films showing what the Huks have done and intend to do.<br>
Prepare propaganda leaflets for distribution. We can start with my letter to my children and the primer.<br>
The political leaders must now be taught how to conduct their own teach-ins.<br>
11:25 PM<br>
Suffered from too much durian which I ate when hungry. Relieved by three doses of gelusil and some food.<br>
After the confidential conferences in the morning, lunch with the Investors Association at Alta Vista which according to Ronnie Velasco has been condemned because of the earthquakes.<br>
2:30 – 3:00 PM – Met with Greg Licaros and Cesar Virata on the Monetary Board meeting which was supposed to pass as amendment to Circular 289 (80-20 retention scheme for the big four; copra, logs, sugar and copper) so that it becomes a ten percent across the board tax on all exports in excess of P5 million in 1968.<br>
But the senators who have been told of the holding back of exports because of the expectation momentarily of the passage of the lower export tax bill are standing pompously and pettily on their hurt pride. “If the monetary board can do it, why should we?” is Sen. Jose Diokno’s expression of senate feeling.<br>
So we have had to postpone action until next week.<br>
Tulungan was inaugurated by Imelda in Tondo this morning. Big success and turn out.<br>

Have just had dinner with the children while Imelda took dinner with Lindy and Cecile Locsin. A lot of ribbing and punning with the children. Imee reported that her mother “is the biggest cheater in the Jane Drew exercises.” In the sit-ups from lying on the back, she pushes up with her hands on the floor. On the bending to touch the toes<br>
opposite the touching hand, she spreads her legs so wide there is no effort to bend, etc. They were all good-naturedly reporting to me that after the ladies go through the exercises, they order all kind of food from the restaurants “so now mommy has gained one pound.” All of them have big hips “forty inches.” That is bigger than my chest at 37 inches I commented. Bongbong proudly claimed that he has only six inches to catch up with me – which claim the girls in a chorus questioned. A jolly good time – then my barber and dentist, the latter working on the teeth left by the Japanese Kempei Tai in Fort Santiago.<br>
Ordered the NBI, the CIS, PC and Metrocom to give support to the investigations of Rep. Pablo Ocampo on vices and corruption in the city which involves the mavor and his brothers, police officers and Chinese as well as an area commander of the Metrocom, Lt. Col. Calderon who has asked to be relieved.<br>
Last night there was a story that Commander Dante was in the Far Eastern University Hospital for slipped disk – but negative results of a check.<br>
We must reactivate the assignment of highly trained squads to track down and get each Huk commander. The squad leader who is a highly trained officer should do nothing but think and act on his mission.<br>

Have just finished a conference with SND, J-2, 1st PC Zone Commander and his S-2 Col. Tomas Diaz, on an assessment.<br>
All the present books on counter-subversion and counter insurgency do not deal with our peculiar problem that is distinguished by a highly sophisticated use by the subversives of media, the schools, the church, labor, peasants and even industrialists in a massive scale. This is not just the 1950 struggle, it is more insidious and perhaps more pervasive. The same objective, the same motivation but more finesse, more articulate eloquence, more propaganda, more intellectuals, more open activism in front organizations – but less arms.<br>
This may be Maoist but it is not based on the Maoist doctrine of the rural areas being the base on the peasants and not the proletariat as the men of the revolution. So the counter-action must equally be more sophisticated<br>
Traditionally the peasants while shown the strength of the Armed Forces, must be given an alternative to communism. In 1950 this was the Eder and the resettlement projects and some government reforms. Today it is the Magalang Agricultural Community Development Project, Tulungan and the Integrated Social Welfare Program,<br>
economic development, CIR and CAR renovations, mobile courts and land reform.<br>

Alex Melchor and his parlour games. The rope trick and the blanket.<br>
I have ordered Makati as the pilot area for the registration of firearms and the organization of weekend warriors.<br>
De Leon, our asset on the Samar Training Camp who reported the death of three of his companions, two from Central Luzon, on the way to the training camp (drowned in the rapids) was subjected by Osmeña, Nic Tumulak and security group to questioning and lie detector test. Osmeña may have finally cleared but he is being sent to Sulu. He excused himself as still being too sick. I believe they intend to liquidate him. We should now submerge him.<br>
We must check the Iloilo situation. We will put up seven intelligence groups as permanent operating units with lateral and vertical channels of communication. Thus one unit would be covering the two islands of Negros and Panay. This is the possible hotbed of dissidence in the South.<br>

She was quite nervous about it. And her teachers were proud of her. An Ilocana teacher commented “Ti paria hangan nga agbunga ti tarong.”<br>
Met with Hanz Menzi on his pulp project, his logging concession in Kalimantan pending with Pres. Suharto of Indonesia, his plantations in Talacag, Bukidnon, Mati, Davao Oriental and Basilan, as well as the publications (Bulletin where he holds 57% of the stock, Emilio Yap 30%, Enrique Zobel a small share and some Americans; Liwayway where he and Emilio Yap are split 50-50).

The training ground set up by Osmeña is close to there. And three men with de Leon, our asset perished in one of the falls of the river, so he is<br>

Gen. Lindbergh is here on the conservation of marine life. His son Jon Lindbergh is head of the U.S. Agency on Oceanography. With him is Theodore Pryor, head of the Foundation on Oceanography. Met them at 9:30 AM then attended the lunch for them where they tried durian and angolas which looked like worms but are eels.<br>
They have come from the Taboli and Obo areas in Cotabato where Lindbergh spent eight days. Pryor is going there too. Both under the guidance of Manda Elizalde.<br>
I am going to declare the Malampaya and Pangil bay estuaries as marine life sanctuaries if we can overcome the obstacles.<br>
Oceanography should be studied more by our people.<br>
And I have directed the Air and Water Pollution Commission to do something about the Pasig River which is now almost pure oil and waste.<br>
J.V. Cruz, the Manila Times columnist and one of my most ardent supporters has suddenly turned against me and suggests that “something has snapped somewhere” and I have become “hysterical” and “govern by intimidation.<br>
This is probably because I have not appointed him Ambassador to Bonn, Germany.<br>

I believe I should proclaim the entire Philippines as a land reform area provided that the farmers will agree not to seek or demand loans from the government for their inputs as we do not have the funds. But I still think that we must organize cooperatives And the Magalang project will be the pilot project for this kind of cooperative.<br>
We have been able to get the senators to agree to a caucus to have me convince them that we must allow the collections from the export tax for our foreign and domestic indebtedness. We meet for breakfast at 8:30 AM Monday, April 27th.<br>
I have appointed Francisco Rabat as chairman of PHILCOA and hope that he will have the drive to organize cooperatives for coconut producers.<br>
Had Leo Virata and Tony Ayala for lunch. Asked them to approve the Menzi application for a pulp and paper plant as there was a letter guaranty of the produce to be bought by them.<br>
Met with J.V. Cruz for lunch and he claims he is worried about the control of the military over government. So I explained to him that we must keep a dialogue with the military as they could be a threat if I did not dominate them morally.<br>
I am appointing him Ambassador to Bonn, Germany as this seems to be his wish and I promised this to him during the campaign of 1969.<br>

AID is pulling out at least twenty percent of its personnel as the U.S. decides to withdraw aid all over the world. This has been in the offing for several years. But perhaps it is about time we cut off all aid to us and really be self-reliant.<br>
We are losing $7 million daily in dollar earnings because of the refusal of the senators to pass an acceptable export tax bill. They want to sterilize the entire proceeds in the Central Bank. But our debts are coming up. At the same time the senate version prohibits further borrowing. It amends the Charter of the Central Bank and stops all open-market operations of the bank.<br>
So I have called a caucus of the congressional leaders tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM to work out a compromise.<br>
Boni Ysip reports that another military group headed by Ex-Gen. Tiro Fajardo has organized and is in touch with the original group of Terry Adevoso.<br>
Ex-Pres. Macapagal and family has left for Dacca, Pakistan. Adevoso and some other cabinet members of his including Mayor Asistio saw him off.<br>
Ex-Sen. Domocao Alonto has arrived from abroad and wishes to see me. His Ansarul Islam is still being talked about as supporting secession from the Philippines of the Moslem areas. But we are organizing the loyal moslems to fight back if they start anything.<br>

In the breakfast this morning I convinced the senators and congress leaders to agree to:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2004" data-line-end="2005">A flat rate of 10% for all exports more than $5 million provided that the export incentives bill will be approved.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2005" data-line-end="2009">The proceeds will be spent as follows:<br>
50% for the payment of foreign and domestic obligations;<br>
25% for the counterpart fund for loans from the ADB, IBRD and other foreign sources;<br>
25% for expenses for unfinished productive enterprises.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2009" data-line-end="2012">Only Sen. Jose Diokno is presently opposing the removal of Sec. 5 of the Senate Bill which amends the Charter of the Central Bank, removes the open-market operations of the Central Bank, and stops further loans in excess of the present level of our indebtedness. But this will mean that we will not be able to pay our debts.<br>
We offered a compromise that additional indebtedness will not exceed 15% of the last three years of income.<br>
Opened the convention of the governors and city mayors. I appealed to them:</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2012" data-line-end="2013">To be in the forefront of change so that we will not allow the radicals to preempt our right as leaders chosen by our people.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2013" data-line-end="2014">That our times are crucial and each and everyone of us will determine the future of our country in the next century.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2014" data-line-end="2016">That we must now establish centers of activity other than Metropolitan Manila. That the reason Manila is the center of authority is because the President holds office in Manila, so I will now hold office in regional office.<br>
4 That local development is dependent more upon the initiatives of the local leaders than on the experts of the national government. Cigar rolling factories in Cagayan was my example.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2016" data-line-end="2017">That they must now help develop cooperatives of agricultural producers to tie up with consumer cooperatives so that there will be local markets in the provinces. Right now the only market is in Manila.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2017" data-line-end="2018">That island provinces should look into the development of refrigerated warehouses. That this could be utilized also by other and inland provinces. Gov. San Luis of Laguna immediately asked that I reverse the decision of GAO that the savings of the provinces cannot be used for cooperatives.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2018" data-line-end="2024">That I will proclaim land reform for the entire Philippines before the end of my term but that we have no funds for credit to the tenants and the small land owners should be banded into farm cooperatives, as it is true that larger farms are more efficient.<br>
Electrification.<br>
Vocational and agricultural schools.<br>
Take issue openly with the enemies of liberal democracy – those specially who would use violence.<br>
We will tolerate debate. But we should not forfeit our right of reply. For we have more valid arguments. History is on our side.<br>

Am still awaiting word from the conference committee on the stabilization tax on whether they have agreed on the version that we worked out. Substantially as we agreed in the caucus but 25% of proceeds to be sterilized in a special fund in the Central to be spent only by Congressional authorization; the prohibition of additional indebtedness when there is inflationary dangers and the categorization which is the subject of contention in the Savoy Hotel conference committee meeting.<br>
My feeling is that Sen. Pres. Puyat, Majority Floor Leader Tolentino and Chairman on Ways &amp; Means Lagumbay are protecting their private interests – setting 10% for the big exports (logs, copra, sugar and copper concentrate) and 8% for the rest including dessicated coconut and plywood of Puyat, Lagumbays and Tolentinos retainers.<br>
If this is the only way to pass the bill we will have to accept the categorization although Lening Veloso who feels that the congressmen have been kept out of the deals with the exporters says the House wants only one category and a flat rate of 10%. The Secretary of Finance is there with them.<br>
Greg Licaros called me up to say that we may get the $50 million loan by Thursday.<br>
My stamina is increasing. A daily heavy exercise routine morning and afternoon and I do not feel tired.<br>

The conference committee on the stabilization tax bill approved the conference report with the amendment that instead of sterilization of the last 25% of the proceeds it goes to the DBP for the payment of its obligations. I sent Leo Virata to the Senate to explain to the Nacionalista senators’ caucus that he has obligations that are urgent – $67 million by the end of the month and $289 million by the end of June.<br>
The House has approved the conference report but the Senate is still debating it although Senate President Gil Puyat promised they would hold on and keep the session going until it is approved.<br>
The Labor groups have allegedly withdrawn their invitation for me to address them on Labor Day, May 1st. Before that Sec. Ople on his own announced that for security reasons I am not attending the Labor Day celebration. Labor is supposed to demonstrate against Congress and me because I certified the bill on minimum wage for P8 for industrial and P5 for non-industrial workers.<br>
Ople recommends that I meet with the labor leaders and I have agreed to do so tomorrow noon at 1:00 PM. But I do not wish to compromise as the labor leaders are getting too arrogant and are trying to intimidate the Congress and me.<br>
Actually the minimum wage should be P7 and P4.50.<br>
Gov. Primicias won against Gov. Isidro Rodriguez who is feeling hurt for the Chairmanship of the League of Governors and City Mayors. Inducted the new officers including Cocoy Romualdez as Vice Chairman, Gov. Roño secretary general.<br>

San Isidro, Magalang for an inspection of the Home Defense Forces or the self-defense forces. It is a model. They have a good 93 men. But their trenches need overhead cover as the Huks have M-79’s.<br>
10:30 – Fort Magsaysay, 30 minutes by helicopter. Graduation of 6 months trainees mostly from Ilocos Sur and Pangasinan; 34th Anniversary of the Tabak Division and a demonstration of the Infantry Batallion with tank armor, artillery support (105’s and mortars 81 &amp; 42) and helicopter transport. We must improve our artillery and use the helicopters for fire support. Communications good – all messages in Tagalog. The “over” sounded strange when translated into “Tapos.” Air drop of the pathfinders off the drop zone. Vice Chief of Staff Romeo Espino dropped with them from 6,000 feet. In actual combat they drop from 12,000 three days before combat to mark out the drop zone. Two of them were carried by an updraft two miles beyond the camp.<br>
Objective was a hill marked with a circle. Artillery preparation four minutes only.<br>
Arrived Manila by Fokker 2:30 – 30 minute flight. Conference on Labor Day possible violence. Golf – only 5 holes. Have recovered my wrist action and am hitting harder.<br>
Cesar Virata and the export tax bill at 8:30 PM while I was conferring with Ralph Nubla. Cesar came with Dr. Sicat who has agreed to take over the chairmanship of the NEC. He is a UP professor.<br>

At the side door they had all their pets, the dogs including old Blacky my old pet German shepherd in San Juan and young Urduja – Button the small Shetland pony, Snow White and the Ilocano sheep.<br>
Breakfast – then met with Mr. Aquino, the head of UN FAO with Mr. Joseph to whom I have given a plaque as he is leaving for Rome, and Dr. Faronki. They are giving us millions of dollars worth of food for our big impact projects, Nutritional program in Medicare, the Pantabangan as well as others like Candaba fishponds and reclamation.<br>
Signed the Stabilization tax bill at 12:00 AM. Then met the labor leaders. Delivered my labor day speech over television and radio on the State Dining Room.<br>
Napped up to 5:00 PM from 4:00 PM. Then exercised with Imelda who later walked with me, Greg Licaros and Bobby Benedicto who both arrived later, in the golf course.<br>

I write this on the 3rd as we were busy up to 1:30 AM last night with Meldy and after that I fell asleep. Woke up at 5:30 but went back to bed till 8:00 when Imelda and I talked in bed about all the things she and I had been through together since we were married in 1954 when I was but a congressman. We agreed we had been well blessed by God. She was concerned about Bongbong going to England and how we would miss him. When I laughingly asked her what she would do if he brought home a child with an English mother, she said seriously and intensely – “keep the child but not the mother.” She thought that we would then have a child to play with. I jokingly asked why she felt that way about her son but not about her husband, she said, I love you so much I would be willing to allow you to have a child by another woman if you wanted it (another child) so much, but I have to be there and you must do so not because of love for the woman. Of course we both laughed the thought off with unanimous assurances of love.<br>

Have just issued the statement in Puerto Princesa that the operations of the South Vietnamese and American troops against the Vietcong and Vietminh in Cambodia is not an invasion but a measure of self-protection which any commander in the field would take given the situation of the privileged sanctuary of supply depots, arms and ammo factories, communications and headquarters from which the Vietcong and Vietminh continuously stage repeated attacks. I suppose it will make the headlines tomorrow.<br>
Ambassador Byroade says tonight that the American bombers (100 of them) have bombed North Vietnam missile and anti-aircraft sites. They should have done this a long time ago.<br>
The damage in Cambodia must have been terrific because the enemy did not expect it and their installations are all on surface. I presume their anti-aircraft is not as sophisticated as in North Vietnam.<br>
If the supplies from Cambodia are cut, the Vietcong and Vietminh fighting in South Vietnam will be greatly weakened.<br>
Nixon is under attack from some of the U.S. congressional leaders but he did the right thing and if he pushes it through, he may become a great President because it is just possible that if Red China reacts violently and starts war, that may be the end of Red China. I believe Russia will keep quiet about it and let Red China stew in her own sauce.<br>
The decision of Nixon will strengthen the free nations of Asia and weaken the home-grown communists who have been encouraged by the wishy-washy American policy.<br>
The countries in the Chinese mainland are the ones who must be cheering the most specially Laos, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and Korea (of course Cambodia).<br>
We reached Puerto Princesa at 3:00 PM sharp. We had left off Ambassador Byroade in the lifeboat and guarded by the destroyer escort at the entrance to the bay at 2:00 PM. He came back at 5:30. He or rather Mrs. Cecille Locsin caught a spanish mackerel which was cooked as kilawin for dinner.<br>
Cast off at 7:00 PM for Ursula. I have asked everybody to go to bed at 10:00 PM so we can wake them up at 4:00 AM, give them 30 minutes to dress up, start ship to shore movement at 4:30 and be on the beach for the 5:20 sunrise and the waking up and departure of the birds.<br>

We were all wet so we went swimming after which I went into the forest.

And the birds were in the forest which had no thick underbrush. I am told there were some hunters there a week ago.

Arrived at Taganak at S:15 PM. The mayor led us to eight young turtles and two nests. We hunted around for the eggs with the aid of an iron prod with which you can feel the eggs like rubbery obstacles. Then we saw a giant mother turtle.<br>
We have just had a discotheque with everybody in the weirdest clothing. This was organized by the children. The last piece was 17 minutes long and anybody who sat down before the end was considered ancient, the children proclaimed. The “olds” also had to keep on at it till the fatiguing end.<br>
The sea is a little rough. The ship is pitching and yawing as we are in the Sulu Sea on the way to Sibuto where we hope to hunt boar before we go to General Santos and the Dole Pineapple plantation.<br>

Aboard the 777<br>
I write this on the th as we went to bed at 2:00 PM last night after a futile hunt for wild boar until 11:30 PM. We had decided to postpone our trip by twelve hours as we could hunt only in the evening.<br>
Father , (Sibutu Notre Dame School) has done a fine job. When I landed on the airstrip there in 1965 I landed in the Aero-Commander the Irene on 450 meters of rough corral. Now it is 840 meters planted to Bermuda grass which was brought by Father Chalkey from Jolo in 196&amp;. A Queenaire could land there easily. The campus is all lovely Bermuda grass.<br>
There was a program given by the people of the island led by Deputy Gov. Bandon and Acting Mayor Inna Carlos formerly 1st Councilor as Mayor Mansur was suspended Judge Bidui (from Sibutu) of the Jolo CFI for anti-graft charges. congratulated the people for their helping themselves. There is no doctor or nurse, only a midwife so I have directed Sec. Cruz to appoint a rural health doctor for the municipality of Sitangkai of which Sibutu is a part.<br>
We were to leave at 12:00 noon to give Ambassador Byroade some time to fish but as he had not been able to get any and we wanted to hunt so I could get Bongbong to kill his first boar with me, we decided to leave at night after the hunt.<br>
We were prepared to be in place at 5:00 PM but we were at the father’s place at 4:00 PM. He brought us to the Pool of the Eleven Thousand Virgins which was a deep dark pool under a balete tree and in a deep cavern with an overhanging limestone ledge over it. Small (probably ten meters by ten) but cool and lovely. By the time we returned to the Notre Dame school, it was 5:30 PM (4 kilometers) and Imelda and Ambassador Byroade (who had gone fishing in the afternoon) were waiting for the only jeep in the island then at our disposal, so that it was six o’clock when we went to the hunting place which was to the eastern side of the island by a narrow path which the jeep could hardly negotiate (about five kilometers) and another two or three kilometers in the dark to the perches for us. These are rickety platforms ten meters up a coconut tree where we were to wait for the boar.<br>
I was with Bongbong and Aquil our guide. We had gone out the farthest from the road, passing through the seashore which was white sand typical of the islands in these seas. Bongbong was armed with the Steyr-Marlicher .223, I had a Remington 12 gauge shotgun which scope I took off and for which I had to borrow three shotgun shells (buckshot double 0) because the men had brought number 4 shots for the magnum 3 inch and no. 8 trap loads for the regular 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shotgun; Aquil was holding the .22 Martin magnum.<br>
We waited for four hours. We could hear the soughing of the surf and fish falling back on the water like a rifle shot. I could smell the jungle again. And even if we had used OFF repelant, I still got beaten by some insects.<br>
Bongbong was excited when we climbed up those wobbly steps nailed uncertainly to the coconut trunk and he whispered to me “We are really here, Daddy.”<br>
In a way I am glad we got nothing as it will teach the boy patience. He was quite self-restrained for his age.<br>
My feet hurt from the long hike as my shoes were too thin-soled for it. And it reminded me of the many marches in the jungles long, long ago as I smelled the jungle again.<br>
But I must bring him to Cagayan to shoot his first boar and duck.<br>
We did hear one of the boars rooting around in the bushes and crack a coconut or two but he did not come out in the open as Aquil did not turn on the flashlight he was holding for the occassion.<br>

Imelda and the children will sleep in Dole then return to Manila by boat. I hope to meet them half-way in Mactan.<br>
Ambassador and Mrs. Byroade are coming with me in the Fokker tomorrow.<br>
The Ambassador and I have been able to work out some difficulties about the bases and the negotiations to come. So I am instructing Sec. Makasiar to work out all the details.<br>
And the resolution filed by Cong. A. Diaz of Zambales to request me to declare Admiral Lambert and other base officials as persona non grata I have asked to be stopped. Cong. Diaz has become a pompous impertinent tyrant according to Mayor Gordon of Olongapo.<br>

Romulo to attend the Djakarta conference called by Foreign Minister Adam Malik of South East Asian or rather Asian countries to see if we cannot solve the Cambodian question. Met him and Sec. Romulo at 4:30 PM. Arrived at 2:35, showered and slept for 30 minutes. Then conferred with my Executive Secretary, Sec. Ponce Enrile, Com. Edmundo Reyes on the Yuyitong case. They explained that these two brothers were both planning a sudden disappearance and were also in danger of liquidation by rightist elements.<br>
Registration of guns liberalized – Sec. Ponce Enrile ordered.<br>
Status of investments and incentives with Leo Virata and Tony Ayala.<br>
Then worked out the position papers for the Executive Committee Meeting of the National Security Council for Saturday. Meeting of the Foreign Policy Council on Tuesday.<br>
Greg Licaros leaving Saturday on the restructuring of the dollar loans. Worked out the details with Cesar Virata.<br>
Boy Tuason died in a PAC plane crash at 8:00 AM. One of the engines caught fire on take off. The pilot tried to turn back and crashed instead. Jayme Zobel who was hurrying home from Sibutu was supposed to be in that plane.<br>

I write this only tonight as the trip by boat last night was rough and I went to sleep at 11:00 PM. We started from Pier 15 at 8:15 and arrived at the San Fernando pier at 9:45 AM today. Outside the breakwater we were on a SE course with the wind from the North so we were rolling a little. This stopped when we rounded Cochines point at the south of the Bataan Peninsula. But the swells in the China Sea made Bongbong sick, he had to be given half a bonamine. Stevie Cu Unjieng vomited twice and Tessie Yulo once. But the rest were all good sailors.<br>
In the morning I left at 7:30 AM to Lipa City – Fernando Air Base to speak at the graduation of the Flying Cadets (19) and student officers (12 and PMA’ers). Had to travel by car and it took us one hour and a half because of the fact that the airplane crashes have made Meldy nervous everytime I fly. (We just received from PAL the picture of the AVRO plane that crashed at Pantabangan with its tail section blown off apparently by explosives, then the right wing disintegrating then turning upside down just before impact on the ground). The PAC plane of Boy Tuason, Andy Roxas and Peggy Lim had an engine burn on take-off, the pilot feathered it but banked steeply on the dead engine instead of the functioning one, so stalled and crashed on its nose. The PAL Fokker plane that crashed in Iligan took off below minimal requirements as it was raining heavily and visibility was 100 yards, hit a mound of dirt on the side, twisted around and burned after all the passengers had escaped the plane. The stewardess who was about to put on her belt was thrown off the door that flew open and died of a cracked skull (the only casualty).<br>
Returned to Manila at 10:30 AM to arrive at the Escolta PNB building at 12:00 to address the Rice and Corn Federation convention.<br>
Then went to Malacañang at 1:00 PM to meet Gen. Menzi on his Pulp and Paper project and the PHILCOX man, Tony Tiotko on the navigational aids valued at $12.5 million they are installing.<br>
At 3:00 PM after some conferences and a 15 minute nap, I was at Del Monte to inaugurate the new 15,000 cavan a day rice polishing and processing plant of the Mindanao Progress Corporation of Roberto Tulio. Conference at Bonifacio 4:30 PM to 7:00. Malacañan to pick up some books, papers and clothes and was at the boat at 7:30 PM where I met Henry Martel on the Navotas reclamation project of Ramon Clinamco and Monching Cojuangco on the PLDT franchise which Maj. Fl. Leader Veloso badly mishandled. I had warned him that his asking ₱200,000 only for Montano the minority floor leader was going to lead to a scandal. Monching Cojuangco also went ahead and paid the grease money although I do not believe Lening when he says that he did not keep any part of it. The House on the motion of Maning Zosa and the promptings of Danding Cojuangco voted to recall of the franchise and now there is a serious move to change Veloso as majority floor leader.<br>
I scolded Monching a little for the bungling.<br>
Imelda is smarting from Nini Quezon Avanceña’s remarks to Fanny Aldaba Lim that we may be hardworking, intelligent and sincere but we are making too much money. She mentioned Al Yuchengco. We are also supposed to own Atlas, Dole, AG&amp;P and other big corporations. If they only knew!!!<br>

Imelda is depressed that we have had no children after Irene. She was overdue since the 13th but on the 25th had it. Since then she has been feeling frustrated. But everything depends on God. If He wills it we will have more children. And we will take all the necessary medical measures to have some more. I would like to have another son.<br>
And I am at my healthiest. I am healthier now than I was at forty years.<br>
There is a slump in the stock market in the U.S. affecting all the other countries and including the Philippines. This is the time to buy. Even Benguet Consolidated has gone down to Five Dollars but today went up to Six Dollars. So when I was asked for advise, I said that now is the time to buy.<br>
We must develop our mining industry. And everybody is looking for mines. Chino Roces and Max Soliven have written the Human Rights Commission that we violated the Declaration of Human Rights in deporting the Yuyitongs. So the Sec. of Foreign Affairs must answer this communication.<br>
Max Soliven is a frustrated politician who would like to go back to the district of his father and follow on his footsteps but cannot. He is taking it out on me. Chino Roces is a naive and weak little tyrant who wants to control presidents and be kowtowed to.<br>

Imee says that an Americanita of about eleven years of age had a crush on Bongbong in the Jumbo jet 747 and last night the Japanese girl at the Osaka restaurant cooking their sukiyaki complimented him for his good looks. I told him tonight over the telephone that he was getting swell-headed.<br>
The children left Hongkong by Jumbo jet as Pan-Am has a Jumbo flight everyday that leaves at 9:00 AM Hongkong Time which is one hour ahead of Manila. They arrived at 12:45 PM but landed at 1:15 PM. They stay at the new Imperial Hotel. They had a rough trip. Up to now it is still raining in Manila as it did yesterday even in the making of the pledge at Rizal Park. And the children say that the landing was like a house coming down in an earthquake.<br>
Had nine holes in the USAFIP-Maharlika tournament at Fort Bonifacio. Then had a conference. Met the Capitan del Barrio and the people of 8 provinces and about 600 doctors of PGH led by Director Pascual recommending my brother Dr. Pacifico Marcos for the position of Chairman of the Medical Care Commission.<br>
Then met with the Meralco group to look into the Chronicle and ABS-CBN malicious distortions of news and mischievous commentaries.<br>
We may have to organize a new corporation to publish the Bulletin, Liwayway and now also the Evening News, Republic and possibly MBC which includes Channel 11.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2210" data-line-end="2219">We have just said goodbye to Father James Donalan who went to England to look into all the schools that Bongbong could go to. He recommended Worth Abbey School.<br>
He recommended it because of its spartan system that develops individual initiative, the youth and progressiveness of the rector (Benedictine), the tutorship (there are thirty members of the faculty and only 300 boys. The Soriano and Delgado boys are there). Father Donalan says that when a boy has finished the 4th, 5th and 6th Forms one is a junior in an American college.<br>
So I have prepared a letter and cable to be sent to Father Dominic, Worth father rector, to enroll Bongbong for the next term.<br>
There are some criticisms (specially Max Soliven) of the decision to send Bongbong to England but it offers the best education for a boy. In the Philippines, he is either spoiled or hated because he is the President’s son. And he has to learn to stand on his own. But he has to learn Ilocano before he goes. So I may send him to the north first.<br>
I am now working on the monetary policies – and the reforms in the government financing institution.<br>

Diaz on PC matters which is correct but impolite. I have called a conference on smuggling and army problems tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 PM then dinner.<br>
Bongbong has started his Latin and French lessons under Mr. Sung as he has never taken these in school. I have also gotten him to work on his British history. He has only taken Pre-Roman and a part of the Roman period.<br>
Bongbong has started to call me ERPI – a contraction of ERPAT, the inverse of PATER. He is beginning to use his latin.<br>
Hikky – We just got instructed on French kissing by our children. The black mark on Imelda’s neck which I put on her the other day was immediately called a Hiki by our two eldest – the result of a sucking kiss.<br>
We are all sleeping in our bedroom tonight. The children were all kidding us that if there should be another child, they would all be “DJALOUZ.” I suggested in jest that their mother was willing for me to have children by other women and they said “Unthinkable.” Although they were laughing, I knew they were serious.<br>
I told them, too, that if Mommy should ever leave us, I would never marry again.<br>
Bongbong said in bravado, “Why do you want any other sons when I am worth a thousand sons.” And I hope he will be.<br>
I told him I want him to be challenged. He retorted he needed no challenge to be good.<br>

Imelda visited Nini this afternoon with Dr. Estefania Aldaba Lim to make amends for the hurt that Hartzel Spence’ book on me. And she brought my letter of regrets. For the book had made it appear as if Pres. Quezon had persecuted me when the truth was that the subalterns, Maj. Guado of the NBI, then Fiscal Macadaeg, the Valle brothers of Tarlac, had done the falsification of the evidence specially the testimony of Calixto Aguinaldo from sheer bureaucratic overzealousness.

Am pushing the setting up of occupancy installations in Flat Island and Naushan Island because Freedom Island or Itu Ato has been occupied by the Nationalist government. I ordered the Air Force to air-photo the islands and they have submitted their report. The occupancy of Flat Island and Naushan Island will protect our shores – Palawan and our present grant of oil drilling rights in the Palawan shelf to the Seafront.<br>

Received the letter of Nonong signed Manuel L. Quezon Jr., expressing happiness over “my gentlemanly letter” that “vindicated the honor of father and sister by rejecting the unjust imputations and insinuations levelled at them.” Formal and a little cold, I thought.<br>
Vice Pres. Lopez wrote me insisting upon his power to control and supervise the Bureau of Forestry including the issuance of licenses. But I am certain this is done by his men who wish to continue collecting from the licenses.<br>
I worked on the oil concession applications. And asked Ting Paterno and Cesar Virata to finish the letter to the Jacintos on the IISMI converting government preferred shares to common voting shares and putting IISMI under a new management, foreign if necessary.<br>

Saturday<br>
7:00 PM<br>
The Daily Mirror (most of the wise coffee-shop habitues call it the Daily Error) headlines that Sen. Lagumbay is being punished by me for refusing to sponsor tax measures – which is completely false as the truth is this is a Senate matter triggered by the newspapers and taken over by the Perez committee. I could not in conscience do anything but authorize the BIR to reveal his name.<br>
Now Aytona is caught in a bind for conflict of interest.<br>
The PNB Union and PAGE (Phil. Association of Government Employees) are also threatening a strike or demonstration.<br>
They could not come at 6:30 PM and so I meet them at 12:00 noon tomorrow.<br>
Played golf early in the tournament at Bonifacio to raise funds for the watering system.<br>
Came back to the Palace in a hurry to catch the Ilocos Norte mayors and delegation being briefed by Imelda on their program for me on Monday, the eve of my birthday celebration. Retreated when Imelda shooed me away.<br>
Inaugurated at 5:00 PM the CAA-PAF management operation and information center. Gave a plaque of appreciation to Gen. McNickle of the 13th Air Force USAF for the help like the radar we are using at MIA now, electric generators after the earthquake, etc.<br>
1:10 AM<br>
Have just arrived from Sec. Romulo’s house at Forbes Park where the cabinet tendered me a dinner for my birthday celebration on the 1st of September.<br>
He had been able to collect an impressive collection of cablegrams from heads of state and heads of government. Although this message-sending is a yearly occurrence.<br>
Dinner was up to 10:00 PM – then a reception and dance up to 12:15 AM.<br>
This is a tradition I hope will be followed throughout the years as a President must depend for success upon his cabinet.<br>
We also had the first picture taken of the cabinet with me (only the Vice-President was absent).<br>
I am getting all the cabinet men to work. As I said in my response to Sec. Romulo, there is one basic difference between the cabinet of Pres. Quezon and my cabinet and that is that Quezon’s cabinet was composed mostly of political kingpins while my cabinet is composed of technocrats mostly without political backing.<br>
I also announced the policy of more autonomy for bureau directors and department heads as well as the objective of establishing a civil service that can operate efficiently without the intervention except on basic policy of an elective legislature or even the President or department head.<br>

The talk of the town is still the capture of Commander Sumulong. The Liberals are sour graping as usual, Roxas and Aquino insinuating that it was a rigged-up surrender and not a capture. They just want their names in the front pages.<br>
It turns out that he was turned in by a certain Ato, a former close-in security man whom he trusted but whom he had scolded about money.<br>
One of the first men he wanted to talk to was Cong. Cojuangco whom he wanted to secure a lawyer for him.<br>
Talked to Imelda at Lisbon (a 7-hour time difference) for more than an hour (1:10 PM to 2:15 PM.) She was given tea by the President and the Sec. of Foreign Affairs was giving her a reception in the afternoon.<br>
She talked of what Bongbong had told her when she called him last from London. The pictures in his album had one of the family against the giant chandeliers of the palace and some of his classmates wanted to know if his father was a minister since we seemed to be in a cathedral. And he has already cured the sniffles of a roommate with Decolgen. Breakfast is not so bad as he gets a one-inch thick ham. For lunch and dinner the food seems substantial. But he has to clean the bathroom and classroom. And he is acquiring the technique so he can finish this in five minutes. He has avoided rugby until he learns the game but he has sported around his judo green belt. He feels some of his classmates are “stupes” and he is “doing well indeed” in his classes. So much so he is in the senior class in mathematics. But his uniform is three sizes too large and his mother left him no English currency and the school store would not accept his dollars. A second year boy sneered “These Asians” when he was with a Middle East boy in the first day and he cursed him back in Tagalog. But since then he has not consorted with the Middle East boy as the hijacking Arabs are not exactly popular. Otherwise he has made friends with all the 200 classmates.<br>
Apparently he likes it out there although he says he will take the first plane home next December.<br>
I am glad the school disciplines the students and makes them work cleaning bathrooms and classrooms as well as helping the monks in cleaning up the walls. Bongbong says that the teachers do not press you to study but if you do not you just flunk and have to take the subject all over again. This will instill not only self-discipline but also develop initiative.<br>
He is turning out to be a businessman. He has sold chocolates and balisong. He will probably earn more than his two pounds allowance per month.<br>
But he wants to travel to Scotland and Ireland. And I believe we should encourage him in this.<br>
One of the biggest surprises of our lives is the report that the locker of Bongbong is so neatly arranged that the housemaster has referred to it as a model for the other boys. Three cheers for him!<br>
Met some of the oil concessioners. I may have to order a rebidding of the concessions in the Sulu-Palawan area.<br>
Asked the Jacintos and Sen. Aytona in the dinner I invited them to, to go to Washington and find out if the report is true that the Export Import Bank will not restructure the IISMI loan if they do not improve management and equity.<br>
The Japanese suppliers are ready to help restructure their raw material loans of $72.5 million as Nanding Jacinto claims the Japanese cannot cut their credit because we are the biggest buyer of iron raw materials.<br>
We will have to wait for the return of the Jacintos.<br>

Sometime ago she threatened that if she was not paid a big sum of money, she would scandalize me and spread all forms of lies about me.<br>
A diabolical plot. But what a well prepared one it is. And I<br>
And we are impotent to do anything as this woman wants publicity. If we file a libel or blackmail case, she will just thrive in it. And it will blow up the whole thing into an international affair and fair game for everyone.<br>

I attach all the papers –including pictures which show the extortion.<br>
I have asked the editors to check the story and not use it. Everybody cooperated except Taliba which printed a mean and vicious story.<br>

I write this as I stay by Imelda who is in bed in our bedroom as she is feeling sick.<br>
We are trying to call up Col. Los Baños, the military attaché in London, so we can tell him to allow Bongbong to come home by plane alone but to inform the embassies on the way to watch for him. He may be coming from London on the 10th with the Zobel boys by Quantas which has a direct flight to the Philippines and Australia.<br>
And I am trying to call Bobby Benedicto. I have talked to him to rib him about his cable. He informs me that the interrogation of Mendoza was shown over TV in New York which is incidentally very cold. Mendoza said it was President Marcos who parried his thrusts with his kris-dagger and who prevented him from killing the Pope.<br>
Met Mr. D.G.H. Rowlands of Thompson Foundation of England. He is the editorial studies director.<br>
Signed the pardons for prisoners as I promised the Pope. And I have ordered that the prisoners penalized with imprisonment of not more than 5 years be kept in the provinces with expenses to be divided between the national and the provincial governments.<br>
Am working on the recovery programs, the legislative proposals and the new development projects.<br>

Imelda and I are going to sleep at Suite I which is actually the guest room for heads of state. Our big bed which was blessed by the Holy Father is there. Imelda and I had sentimental reminiscences of Paris and New York in November on our honeymoon in 1954 bacause of the chestnut glace.<br>
Talked to Bongbong and Father Bernard. Bongbong says the attempted assassination of the Pope was prominent front page in the London newspapers and while they explained that there had been doubt as to who had saved the Pope’s life, Mendoza, the would be assassin had been asked and he had pointed to me as the man who had parried the knife thrusts. And Bongbong is quite proud of his father. “Runs in the family,” he bragged. Father Bernard says in the last fortnight Bongbong has been lazy but well adjusted. He makes believe he knows but he does not. In history he has been observed to be “flippant” and his ideas not well thought out.<br>
Bongbong leaves Worth on the 10th, leaves London for Rome by Alitalia at about 10:00 AM on the 11th, takes PAL from Rome to Manila and arrives at Manila at about 2:00 PM on the 12th (Sunday).<br>
Am working on cooperatives, free schooling, electrification, land reform, manpower training and the other projects.<br>
Mons. Gavin of Malaysia has issued the statement that he did not see me parry the<br>
knife thrust of Mendoza. This appeared in The Evening News.<br>
The Daily Mirror, however, carried the statement of the Archbishop of Indonesia to the effect that he did see me do so.<br>
As usual in the occurrence of a sudden and fast event, there are several versions. Doroy Valencia, the columnist, says, who should know best but the would be assassin, Mendoza.<br>

Bongbong has just arrived. His plane a KLM-PAL DC-8 on direct flight from Amsterdam touched down at about 3:00 PM. A sizeable crowd with the usual palace friends and their children were there to greet him. The people up in the visitors terrace shouted “Bongbong” and waved to him happily. You could see they were as glad as we were to see him home for the holidays.<br>
And we have been excitedly preparing for his arrival. His room has been refurnished and redone by Pandot Ocampo. We have put in our share.<br>
The girls fixed up his and their rooms to look lived in and cozy. I put in there the stamps we struck for the Pope on his visit and the knives given me by Mayor Hernando of San Nicolas.<br>
And we had the horses waiting for him at the aviary. His horse Argentina was there and at first he shied away from him. Button and Kitten were also there. The dogs were inside because it was showering as it has been the whole day. His favorite, Sandy, of course was there. And so was Achilles the Dalmatian and the two chows, Butterball and Alaska.<br>
After the hurry and scurry to look into his room and the peremptory demands for <em>kuwento</em>, we heard mass then merienda when he told us a lot of stories.<br>
He had come to the landing ramp when we were out of the VIP reception room and he apparently had cut his hair short but it still looked long and was way down to his collar.<br>
But the first impact was a pleasant shock. He had lost his darkness and he looked unbelievably handsome. I could see and hear that this was also the effect on his mother and the Ilocano mayors who were there.<br>
He had acquired some kind of an English accent and the peculiary English terms like “frightful,” “dreadful,” “chap.”<br>
But he was changed much deeper than mere accent or adeptness in the English language.<br>
He now placed greater importance on his academics than on sports. He casually announced that he would have to give up his judo as it cuts into his study and work on physics. And he bragged of his being told by his master that they would recommend his elevation or acceleration in physics. He also bragged that he was third in mathematics in a class of 120. Although we did hear of rugby or “rugger.”<br>
Imelda and I are agreed that we made the right decision in sending him to England. And we remembered our fears of friends as well as enemies spoiling him, of drug-addiction, of leftists, threats of kidnapping and the fate of Presidents’ sons in the Philippine society that gave them no incentive for excellence.<br>
Imelda and I were both in tears (of happiness of course) when we met him and talked to him. I noticed that Imelda hugged him longer than usual as I did. And she whispered to me, “You were right, we have lost a child. He is now turning into a man. We can no longer baby him.” I answered. “We will just have to have another child to baby!”<br>
This has been a happy day!<br>

Monday<br>
Our first day with Bongbong. Woke up late believing he would not be able to awake early but he had breakfast with the two girls before seven o’clock.<br>
He looked bored the whole morning as I attended to my visitors — Ambassador Urabe, Mrs. Adelina Rodriguez, the Cavite officials on Sangley Pt. (we decided to inform the American Ambassador we would like to see the turn-over take place finally after one year; we are going to set aside an area for a ship-building complex for Bayside Shipping which is being given reparations items this year and some electronics factories; but best of all finish the coastal road to Cavite City although we will have to wait for the case pending in the sala of Judge de la Rosa of the Pasay City Court of First Instance; the runway is only 8,000 feet long and therefore cannot be utilized for big planes).<br>
In the afternoon we had the Christmas festival at 3:00 PM for the indigent children. Bongbong delivered the speech for the family party in Tagalog and partly in English – “Ikinagagalak kong pinahintulutan akong umuwi nang aking mga magulang at lumahok sa inyo sa mg araw ng kapaskuhan x xx This Christmas is doubly happy for me — It is the kind of happiness that I intensely wish for everyone — for you, all our people, and our country. × xx Maligayang Pasko at Manigong Bagong Taon sa inyong lahat.”<br>
But again the hysterical explosion of greetings for Bongbong. “Guapo si Bongbong,” was the comment. Of course the girls were more excited than the boys. He received all of these as a matter of fact and casually.<br>
After the induction and dinner of the officers of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce led by Mr. Antonio Roxas Chua at which they pledge cooperation with my administration anew, I met Baby Ysmael at 7:15 PM. He brought an air rifle with tranquilizer darts. I asked Bongbong to come and help me get the gun working. He showed scarce interest and went back as fast as he could to his room to do a recording,<br>
I am amazed at the rapport between him and his sisters. Imee had faithfully written him every event that had happened here and now they seemed to have so much to talk about — classes, the idiosyncrasies of his “mawsters,” the characters in his school, what he thought of the Filipino boys in Worth (Iñigo Zobel who he says is known to be rich but thick [thick headed] and is always copying his homework and the Soriano boys who are on their third year in Worth; he does not think very highly of them). They talk of drama, Shakespeare, Bernard Shaw, Janos Joyce and the other writers.<br>
Imelda and I just listen very fondly – too fondly I am afraid.<br>
But he is more orderly in his habits, takes care of his room which used to be untidy before he went to Worth and seems shy with the girls.<br>
Incidentally all the girls big and small wanted to meet him and shake his hand.<br>
He seems decided not to go to Oxford after Worth but to go to the University of the Philippines instead for his law degree. Apparently he is affected by his classmates who seem to think that Oxford was not much.<br>
And anyway, he says, for him to go to Oxford, he would have to stay six years in Worth.<br>
We are letting him make up his own mind. After all he seems to know what he wants.<br>

January 2, 1971<br>
Saturday<br>
Today’s newspapers all cry for some reforms in the Armed Forces. As I wrote yesterday, this is an opportunity to strengthen the military organization in motivation, orientation and morale.<br>
Gen. Yan reported by telephone about an hour ago that Lt. Victor Corpus and some companions was sighted in Quezon City. The taxi driver who reported it guided the investigators to the houses they were headed for. These houses are now under surveillance. If this is true then the press release of Jose Maria Sison alias Amado Guerrero, Chairman of the CPP (Communist Party of the Philippines) to the effect that Corpus has been welcomed in the field (presumably in Central Luzon) by Commander Dante, is false.<br>
For Jose Maria Sison is crowing about the Corpus raid and has arrogantly announced that there will be more revolutionary activities in 1971. He not only issued a press release for the CPP, he also issued a press release for Corpus, as usual berating U.S imperialism and the “running dogs of the Marcos administration.”<br>
When I was interviewed after the golf game I commented on the crowing and bragging of Jose Maria Sison that “He who laughs last laughs best.” I was then asked later in the afternoon whether this confirmed the story that Lt. Corpus was actually an agent of the AFP on a mission to penetrate the NPA. I said, “Would that not be great if it<br>
were true.” Hana Brown of Far East Broadcasting commented, “To say so would be the kiss of death.”<br>
For the media have practically glorified Corpus – specially Manila Times and Taliba. And Manila Times, specially, has printed statements from the CP as if they (Chino Roces and his cronies) were part of the CPP.<br>
From the vantage point of future plans I cannot but feel a little self-righteous as I witness the spectacle of petty men tearing to pieces the source of their liberty they so easily abuse and the tolerance of which they do not appreciate.<br>
And when I watch the supposedly patriotic men, in their selfish and egoistic ways, wreck our republic, I almost lose my objectivity and dispassionate attitude as anger boils within me and eggs me to immediately put into effect the plan to establish martial law. This I must avoid.<br>
For I will not declare martial law unless there is anarchy or the beginnings of it which prevents the functioning of courts and other government offices, even if the constitution authorizes me to do so when there is “imminent danger of invasion, insurrection or rebellion -and there is actually rebellion going on now.<br>
The silent conspiracy against our republic is joined in by well-meaning men who use the inequities of our society and despair that they can ever be rectified except by radicalism and violence. For there are many valid grounds of grievance as the rich and powerful disregard or are insenstive to the dreams or even the frustrations and pains that torture the masses of our people.<br>
So I must be deliberate, prudent, and wise.<br>
Today’s Manila Chronicle attacked me viciously on everything and for everything. Its editorials and columnists concentrated on calling me names and blaming me for all the ills of the country. Granada’s and Balein’s spite was particularly insulting and biting. For that matter the whole newspaper has been dedicated to me for the past several months but has been specially bitter this last month.<br>
And it is a public secret that Mr. Eugenio Lopez dictates not only policy but the line of attack.<br>
Since I raised the tariff duty of crude oil, I have been their favorite. For the Lopezes own the great majority of Meralco and Meralco pays about forty percent of the crude oil duties as this is the percentage of their consumption. Since we estimate that the increased tariff of crude oil will bring in about P40 million, then Meralco will have to pay an additional P16 million a year.<br>
This is why I am the pet boy of Manila Chronicle. I must remember to keep my rating.<br>

January 3, 1971<br>
Sunday<br>
I went to Ilocos Norte by plane (Fokker) waking up at 6:15 AM to see Baguio in a fog and the plane not yet in Loakan Airfield, going over some papers and issuing instructions, breakfast and dressing up ready to drive to Loakan at 7:00 AM, where we awaited the arrival of Gen. Yan from Manila. He came to meet the PMA cadets returning today from vacation. I conferred with him, Gen. Tanabe and Gen. Ugalde up to about 7:45 when I took off for Gabu Airfield in Laoag where I landed at 8:20 AM.<br>
Conferred on the Corpus incident. Gen. Yan reported that a man described as Corpus had left the Kamuning area in Quezon City for Pasig in a taxi. The places are now under surveillance.<br>
Gen. Yan is beginning to act more decisively. He never did anything about the reports of leftists and subversives in the Armed Forces. One of them is Commodore Lavadia of the National Defense College. He has been an arrogant, insubordinate and petty man not missing a chance to criticize me and the administration and encouraging lectures by Dante Simbulan, Agoncillo and Fr. de la Costa on 6, 7 &amp; 8 October.<br>
But worse than this, he violated security regulations by distributing a classified report of his activities given to him by Gen. Yan.<br>
Attached is a report on Lavadia.<br>
We had an enthusiastic meeting in Laoag where I distributed the usual credit advises, credit cards, highway checks and medical and Maligayang Pasko gifts.<br>
Then to Batac where after the meeting (where I directed the construction of the community hall and the reconstruction of the Municipal Hall) I had a light lunch of alocon and paltat.<br>
Was in Gabu and taking off by 12:35 and in Nichols Airbase at 1:45 PM where Imelda and the children were waiting for me with pospas which I ate in the car. My tummy shows some hyperacidity so I take something every two or three hours. It is most probably due to the tension arising out of the plans for the proclamation of martial law.<br>
I have told Sec. Juan Ponce Enrile about my plan to proclaim martial law in the event of a rebellion or imminent danger thereof. But I told him there must be massive sabotage or terrorism before I declare martial law<br>
His immediate reply was, “It is time you did. You will be surprised at the number of people in all walks of life who will support such a move. Even Ambassador Byroade has hinted that the Americans were expecting it.”<br>
And I explained that there must be violence and destruction by the terrorists so that the people and foreign governments would support our move of proclaiming martial law.<br>
Kokoy. Romualdez told Imelda that Ambassador Byroade has said that I should show a stronger hand in running the government.<br>
I have asked Sec. Ponce Enrile to stay in the camp (Kota Aguinaldo) with his family so that there will be no surprise when he does stay there for security when proclaim martial law.<br>
And the loneliness of self-imprisonment is our destiny the moment I declare martial law. For we will no longer be able to go out of the palace as freely as we do now. Nor can I travel, even abroad.<br>
It will be a more abnormal life than it is now.<br>
And the same thing will be true of Imelda and the children.<br>
But all these and the attendant dangers will be worth it for the future and destiny of our country and people.<br>
Because I know that the country is just drifting on half-measures and compromises – the oligarchs perennially coercing and blackmailing the man in power as the Lopezes are now doing, not far removed from the politicians, and the media distorting and falsifying news and events for its own petty and disreputable purposes.<br>
Our society (or the higher classes of our people) is frivolous and shallow. They seem happy only when they are drunk or are insulting others, friends and foe alike.<br>
We must refashion this society.<br>
We must wage our own revolution.<br>
The concept of ownership must be changed so the small people have a chance. All the crooks in government must be booted out. The media must be geared to development and progress, not to destruction and retrogression.<br>

Today (this morning, 11:00 AM up to lunch at 2:00 PM) in a conference with Sec Juan Ponce Enrile, Sec. Alex Melchor and Gen. Yan, I ordered the setting up of a Special War Center, an Internal Security Agency, a Psy-war Branch all under the DND as well as the creation of a new command, the Metropolitan Command that will cover the provinces of Cavite, Rizal, Bulacan, Bataan, the Pasig Task Force and the PGB under Col. Ver.<br>
I ordered the transfer of Gen. Fidel Ramos from the 3rd Brigade to the 2nd PC Zone vice Gen. Zosimo Paredes whom I am retiring. Col. Palacios, the CO of the Ist Brigade, goes to the 3rd Brigade vice Gen. Ramos.<br>
The Special War Center personnel may also be placed as a component unit of the command of Col. Ver’s as Metropolitan Command CO. It integrates all the special forces of the major services, the special forces and rangers of the Army and Constabulary, the air commandos of the Air Force and the Navy’s marines and underwater teams. They will be retrained under chosen officers for special missions.<br>
As I plan it, in the event of violence in the city, the Metrocom under Gen. Ordoñez will seek to hold back the mass of rioters with his 1,400 men. If they are unequal to the task or special task forces are necessary, the Metropolitan Command comes in. If still unable to contain the violence, then the entire Internal Security Forces under Maj. Gen. Romeo Espino, Vice-Chief of Staff under whom both Gen. Ordoñez and Col. Ver would be subordinated comes into the metropolitan area.<br>
In the meantime outside of the NBI-Metrocom teams that will be fielded, Col. Ver will have special teams to arrest target personnel or take target areas. This will assure performance in the event that BI and Metrocom are committed prematurely to the routine of maintaining order.<br>
I have ordered the PC and 1st Infantry Division at Fort Magsaysay as well as the 51st Engineer Brigade brought up to full strength.<br>
The P3 million needed for the procurement of 3,000 armalites for the PC, I have ordered to be released and the guns delivered not later than the end of February.<br>
The engineers should be ready to take over the public utilities like Nawasa, Meralco, Butel, PNR, PAL, Air Manila, Fairways, land transport as well as shipping.<br>
But the media which according to Sec. Melchor Ambassador Byroade calls a serious threat to security, calls for a separate operation. We have to take them over immediately.<br>
The Psy-War Branch should use them for the purposes of the military administration.<br>
The framework of government and present government officials should be kept and all laws except those I suspend kept in force unless changed by edict by me.<br>
But a new plan of government and society must be worked out.<br>
The lower classes of our people should have a greater share in the profits of both agriculture and industry.<br>
While private property will be recognized and respected, they should be run for the state. Their profits should go to a fund for investment and development.<br>
Or big landed estates should be confiscated by the state and cooperatives established in them in the same manner as the Moshav of Israel.<br>
The crooks of government should be eliminated. There are now so many employees in government we spend ₱1,600 million (one billion six hundred million for our payroll annually). We should cut the expenses for the payroll by ₱600 million which we could use for development.<br>
The Customs and BIR specially should be cleaned up.<br>
Taxes should be increased. The highway and gasoline tax should be increased from 8 centavos a liter to 12 centavos or even 15 centavos. Foreign exchange purchases should be taxed a development tax of 5% at least. Luxuries should not be imported. Inheritance and estate taxes should be increased.<br>
Import and exchange controls should be imposed.<br>
All able-bodied men must be put to work. There must be total exploitation of natural resources.<br>
This must be a complete revolution.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2505" data-line-end="2517">Imelda played a trick on me this morning. It will be one of those family jokes that only she and I will understand – complete in the saying of but a few words. She played her part well as she mischievously embroidered her fanciful story which at first jolted and shocked me out of my wits.<br>
This morning I continued meeting the military. Gen. Rancudo of the Sth Fighter Wing at Basa Airfield who has dreamt to be Chief of Airforce but was set back because I extended Gen. Singson who is now Chief of Airforce. He will make a good Chief of Airforce but I still need him as CG of the 5th Fighter Wing because of the possibility of martial law.<br>
Then I called in the Provincial Commanders of Cagayan, Isabela and Nueva Viscava to size them up. Lt. Col. Suason of Isabel and Lt. Col. …… of Cagayan look like tough fighters. They were CO and Operations Officer of the 51st PC Battalion and part of Task Force Lawin.<br>
I ordered the delivery of 500 firearms for BSDU’s to be organized in Isabela. I also gave it trucks and a U-17 as well as possible helicopter support. One PC company will be sent there next week.<br>
This is necessary because Isabela is becoming a sanctuary of fleeing NPA’s.<br>
I received a recommendation from Sec. Vicente Abad Santos for the relief of Dir. Alejo Santos as Director of Prisons because of the repeated Prison riots at Muntinlupa. I have agreed.<br>
Met Sammy Soriano, an AIB instructor in Australia for the troops being sent to the Philippines by submarine in 1944. He was using for the briefings on Evening Order of Battle intelligence reports of “Ferdinand E. Marcos, Lt. Col. USAFFE.” Reminisced about the war days and Darigayos, Larry Guzman, Don Jameson and Russ Volckman.<br>
Asked Congressman Ali Dimaporo of Lanao del Norte, his brother of Lanao del Sur, Cong. Amni of Sulu and the governor thereat, Gov. Murphy Sangkula to register their unlicensed guns and send their men as reservists for training so they can be used to contain any MIM, Ansarul Islam or Green Guards violence.<br>
In the afternoon, I met Gens. Yan, Espino, Garcia and Sec. Ponce Enrile on the funding of additional enlisted personnel (2,500 to bring PC strength up to 24,000 and 1,000 for the 1st Inf. Division), the contingency plans, training of Muslims in the south on a citizens army basis upon the request of the local officials, the assignment of good combat officers in sensitive positions.<br>
Then I met the doctors of the Dept. of Health led by Dr. Manikan, who are demonstrating for their increase in pay. I told them that the government could afford to give them 35% of their increase the first year beginning April 1971, then 35% the next year and 30% the third year. They would not decide until they met again.<br>
But you could see that they were trying to coerce me and the government with the threat that they would strike if their increase was not given them.<br>

Wednesday</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2524" data-line-end="2547">Delivered one of my best speeches tonight at the Federation of Provincial Press Clubs in the Winter Garden at the Manila Hotel. If I say so myself I felt that it was witty, sharp and incisive but humble and profound.<br>
It was witty when I said I might now be identified with the New People’s Army or the CP, the Communist Party of the Philippines because I accepted the invitation of Mr. Isidro Roman. “You see Mr. Isidro Roman is from Cabuyao, Ilocos Sur the hometown of Jose Maria Sison the Chairman of the Communist Party of the Philippines. (Laughter) But it is worse because you see Mr. Roman is really from Tarlac, the seat of the CCP and PA. That complicates the whole matter.”<br>
“I was stunned this morning to see the four principal metropolitan dailies – now that should be fine because the Star is one of the metropolitan dailies – or is it? – carry the headlines that another PMA graduate, a Lt. Santiago whose father is in Laoag, llocos Norte, my home province, had absconded and joined Lt. Victor Corpus with NPA. called up Gen. Yan, Sec. Ponce Enrile and Gen. Ugalde of the PMA. They definitely told me that Lt. Santiago was right there in the PMA with Gen. Ugalde.”<br>
“I answered: ‘But that must be wrong because the newspapers are always right!” (Tumultuous laughter)<br>
“So I decided to stick to the Provincial Press!”<br>
Then I spelled out my fighting faith that I believe democracy will outlast and survive all other ideologies but that it must be a Philippine democracy that is attuned to our ideals, traditions and dreams. We shall adopt such of socialism and communism as may redound to our welfare. We should not close our eyes to the merits of other ideologies.<br>
Democracy will be able to protect itself. It carries within it the seed of self-preservation. For it is vital and can withstand any test and crisis.<br>
I believe in peaceful reform. I believe in giving the people the right to choose options open to them freely. We should encourage the full and free ventilation of ideas no matter how hurting they may be to the man in power. Evolution, swift or slow, must be brought about but never by violence.<br>
As President I will tolerate indecorous language, boorishness, insult and even libel. I have been libeled and slandered licentiously. So has my family. I will not retaliate. We may differ and differ bitterly. But never will you see me use my powers in spiteful vindictiveness.<br>
I will suffer in silence and allow the searching light of time to bear me out. Slow but inexorable. Even if it means loss of pride and humiliation, I shall adhere to this principle.<br>
But once violence is used by a small minority to force a change or coerce and intimidate government or to take over the powers of government, I will use all the powers of government to repel it.<br>
This is the dividing line – violence.<br>
I informed Ambassador Byroade and Admiral McCain that I expect massive sabotage, terrorism and assassination, even mortar attack because of the reports that the radicals have been given eight million dollars (possibly Hongkong) by someone from Hongkong, and there have been purchases of plastic explosives and jelly in Vietnam. One of the machine shops reports that a base plate for a mortar had been ordered.<br>
I asked if I would be supported if I used sterner measures like the use of the extraordinary powers of the President. I referred to the suspension of the privilege of habeas corpus and martial law. They assured me of support and Amb. Byroade said he would also get the assurance of Pres. Nixon.<br>
I told him that we would soon have trade with Russia and asked him if our recognition of Russia would strain Phil-U.S. relations. He answered in the negative.<br>
He, however, promised that he would send word from Pres. Nixon on this in three days.<br>
I asked for mortar and gun locators, the immediate delivery of the 3,000 Armalites we have bought from U.S. suppliers and the helicopters that are a part of MAP.<br>
But more than this I pointedly stated that we do not expect any American soldier to help us but we do expect the Americans at the least not to intervene in this purely domestic problem in accordance with basic American policy.<br>
Admiral McCain was instant in his assurances of support within their means.<br>
Amb. Byroade agreed to take up with Pres. Nixon the long range program of the training and equipment of our AFP to take over any part of their bases they may give up.<br>
He said that he and Adm. McCain believe that they would need the Subic and Clark Air Force Base for the foreseeable future.<br>
I asked that we discuss the trade agreement and the military problems next June (I am planning the negotiations on the possibility of violence and military take over by March so there will be time to decide what options to take).<br>

Actually I write this at 8:00 PM,<br>
Saturday, Jan. 9th as on Thursday<br>
evening I was ill with a severe cold<br>
which they treated me with Decolgen<br>
resulting in some painful spasms of<br>
the esophagus and which drove me<br>
to bed.<br>
January 7, 1971<br>
Thursday<br>
Bongbong took down the outline I dictated in bed hereto attached.<br>
Dr. Dits Zagala took an electrocardiography and found my heart very sound. That removed all the worries of Imelda and my doctors inasmuch as several of my friends have come down with heart attacks lately. It is the tension of these days.<br>
And I have been working hard lately, although I have been feeling heavy and slothful because of an incipient cold that turned severe after golf in Pangarap where it was terribly cold.<br>
The morning I spent on the cabinet meeting, a study of the government reorganization plan, and the educational survey submitted by Sec. Corpus.<br>
But before that I placated Tony Raquiza who has been issuing press releases demanding the resignation of Sec. Ponce Enrile. He told me that Ponce Enrile had humiliated him and treated him like a job-seeker when he sought to talk to him about the call to active duty of a certain Tomas.<br>
I directed Gov. Licaros to reestablish arbitrage in the sale of stocks of domestic corporations so that we can raise funds abroad.<br>
In the cabinet meeting we reviewed the stabilization efforts of the past year when we succeeded in converting a $300 deficit into a $35 surplus.<br>
And the agricultural recovery program because of the sudden increase of the prices of fruits, vegetables, poultry, eggs and pork. We are spending P35 million on this immediately.<br>
The budget took much of our time as we went over what Com. Sychangco referred to as a “flexible budget.” It looks like we will spend a total of P4.1 billion, P200 million more than last year.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2569" data-line-end="2588">We have decided to make a study of the need of all government corporations and their assets. It started with the recommendation of OEC Administrators to liquidate the Manila Hotel and Cepoc. Sec. Ponce Enrile who was a corporation lawyer before he joined government opined that it would take years to do so. We should sell the assetsinstead.<br>
Apparently all the cabinet members agree on the continuing study of the recommendation to establish diplomatic relations with Russia and other socialist countries except Red China.<br>
After the cabinet meeting which ended at about 1:00 PM. I authorized Sec. Virata to guarantee the new loan of the IISMI at an increased rate of interest which seems unfair as the Export-Import Bank is taking advantage of our difficult situation.<br>
I also directed Sec. Virata to insist upon the Marinduque Corporation to which was given the right to exploit Parcel Il of the Surigao Nickel Mines, the condition<br>
Imelda told me at lunch about the ecumenical funeral of Dean Conrado Benitez. Rather long but impressive.<br>
In the afternoon (about 4:00 PM) after half an hour trying to sleep I attended the Taek-Won-Do-Sikaran-Karate graduation exercises of Task Force Pasig but mostly of my security men. Very impressive. They have been training for five months.<br>
Bongbong could not participate as he is still recuperating from his flu and tonsillitis. But he received his Brown Belt and certificate.<br>
At about the end I was presented with the reconstructed Ruben I (the original keel was discovered and the boat rebuilt on it as well as the crew members and the owner.<br>
This was the boat I used to go to Mindanao from Pagbilao, Quezon (then Tayabas) to contact Col. Ferlig in 1943.<br>
A lump was in my throat as I looked at the boat and it brought in a flood of memories of the guerrilla days when we were all willing to give up comfort, love, life and even honor itself for people and country,<br>
I knew then that I must risk comfort, the future, love, family and even life and honor itself for a people and country the strength of which was being eroded slowly but systematically by their ill-wishers.<br>
But I must be just as cool, deliberate but bold and daring as we were during those dark days of the war.<br>
There was no other course. God had made it so.<br>
So after that I asked Congs. Navarro and Ali Dimaporo to prepare their younger men for training under the concept of citizen military training so that Mindanao could be contained by native troops (even reservists) if trouble started in Luzon.<br>
I then mapped out with Ronnie Velasco the ₱600 million rural electrification program.<br>
I then hurried to the Palace to meet the two factions of the jeepney drivers – one faction headed by Oscar Lazaro helped by Pelagio Villegas and the other by Atty. Lupino Lazaro, Oscar’s first cousin and who was the lawyer of their drivers’ union the Pasang-Masda until they had a falling out.<br>
Oscar and Villegas are willing to stop the jeepney and bus drivers’ strike while Oscar’s cousin, Atty. Lupino Lazaro insists on the strike claiming he cannot stop it anymore.<br>
I felt that they should test their strength and there was no way of bringing down the increase by Villegas of 2 centavos for standard gasoline.<br>

Friday<br>
I have just talked to the same two groups of drivers who both claim to have the majority of drivers. But a great majority of the jeepneys and buses stayed out of the streets.<br>
Still the same positions of the two groups. This time the delegation of Atty. Lupino Lazaro included not only the head of Mapalsat, another union, but also Atty. Angeles of the Consumers Union and Joey Lim. a student leader who criticized the inaction for a long time of the National Price Control Council.<br>
They all demanded that the oil refineries be asked to suspend or cancel the increase of gasoline prices until the National Price Control Council has made a decision on the Villegas rates.<br>
I called up Mr. Wallahan of Caltex and asked him why the prices were increased when we had agreed in Baguio on the 31st that there would be no such increase until we met again in Manila – and we had never met. The reason for my request had been the fact that the National Price Control Council had to approve the Villegas rates before they could be enforced nationally.<br>
The oil refineries would not be able to bring down the prices even if they wanted to.<br>
In the morning I met the Vice President, Sec. Enrile, Sec. Abad Santos, USec. Ingles and Dir. Bunsuego to give approval to their recommendation to approve the Pioneer Oil concession for the Nationalist China Oil their partner to drill and if oil is discovered to exploit the concession getting a 30% share of the oil provided that the safeguards that a foreign government like Nationalist China does not transfer its rights without the approval of our government; that it must register with SEC as a domestic corporation so it can be held liable in our courts; the entry of its technicians to be subject to the usual safeguards.<br>
I am also working on the political philosophy that should be able to rally all the classes of our people in the event of a take-over.<br>
And classifying the records that have to be duplicated and stored in a place other than Malacañang.<br>

Bongbong left by Qantas via Hongkong, New Delhi, Teheran, Athens and London.<br>
I talked to him and his sisters, Imelda and Kokoy about the possibility of his mother and two sisters joining him if there should be trouble here; that whether I am there beside them or not they (the children) should value education and get a doctorate degree because even if we should lose our fortune and position here in the Philippines, then they could make their own way in this world; that if for any reason we should be separated and<br>
I should not be able to guide them after normalcy returns to the world or the Philippines as the case may be, they should return to the Philippines where their roots are; that I would prefer their marrying Filipinos.<br>
Spent the afternoon preparing the records and money he and Kokoy would bring to London.<br>
Spent the whole morning with the oil refineries representatives who as I expected could not budge although they did apologize.<br>
The buses and jeepneys are running normally but I asked PSC Chairman Evangelista to punish those who were not following their franchise by going out.<br>
And asked Sec. Maceda to finish the confurmation of the Villegas rates today.<br>
Maceda, who is an aspirant for senator, wanted to delay and even cut the rate to 1/2 centavo. Bung Tanco called up tonight asking if they could not give the increase by degrees. I did not approve this.<br>
I believe that the answer to all these problems is a government controlled oil refinery in partnership with any of the middle east countries. I attach such a proposal.<br>

Manila<br>
10:15 PM<br>
January 11, 1971<br>
Monday<br>
Open house for the diplomatic corps and the public officials at 9:00 AM.<br>
Then a meeting of the legislative leaders and the cabinet on the legislative program, the state of the nation address, the monetary policy, and diplomatic relations with Russia.<br>
I asked the leaders of both houses to first meet on a legislative program and then see me but they agreed on a development tax (tax on foreign exchange purchases) and a restructuring and simplification of tariff.<br>
We agreed that I would not include any constitutional reforms in the State of the Nation Address.<br>
They agreed to the steps taken to stimulate economic activity by non-inflationary methods. Gov. Licaros explained that there can be no fear of excessive expenditure and borrowing by the government as claimed by Sen. Pres. Puyat and Speaker Laurel because there are legal constraints.<br>
On relations with Russia, we decided to meet in bipartisan caucus with the Chief Justice invited before the 18th. Sen. Pres. Puyat will call the Liberals and set the date.<br>
They agreed that we must give priority to the agricultural recovery program for which ₱35 million has been allocated.<br>
I met Atty. Lupino Lazaro, the leader of the bigger faction of Pasang-Mazda that is striking as he asked to see me on an urgent matter. He revealed to me that some men claiming to be NPA had offered guns to some of the Drivers Association Presidents of Bulacan – that one man had accepted four Armalites and twelve hand grenades. These men were allegedly brought to a house in Apalit – a house allegedly full of guns.<br>
One of the drivers presidents was going to be picked up this afternoon at 4:00 PM to be brought to Tabang then to Bahay Pare.<br>
When I informed Gen. Yan of this for transmittal Gen. Tanabe, he recalled that Gen. Tanabe had disarmed the civilian guards of the mayor of Apalit.<br>
I directed the relief of Commodore Lavadia of the National Defense College for fermenting insubordination among his staff asking them to get any lecturer with or without the clearance of J-2 and not to fear Gen. Yan or Malacañang as if there is no academic freedom he will close the college.<br>
I transmitted the information that the locos Sur local police had been infiltrated by NPA (probably Vigan through Chavit Singson’s uncle, Mayor Singson).<br>
An Aniceto Ramos reports that Lt. Victor Castro has been sighted in San Guillermo, Isabela, then Jones on the way to Palawan where there is allegedly a training ground.<br>
Then a former CIS agent Majusay claims one of our agents, a Francisco Zabala, was with the Castro raiding party and that Castro was brought down from Baguio to Tarlac by the helicopter of Sen. Aquino, then in the senator’s car to Manila, and in the smuggler Delfin Tan’s fast kumpit “Erlinda” from Manila to Brookes Pt., Palawan. They are supposed to go (he has 12 armed men with him to Balabac, then to Borneo then to China.<br>
These reports may be misleading as Lt. Castro was definitely located in Quezon City sometime in the 4th of January. A Lt. Vila was brought by Lt. Ferronil and a hippie-looking young man to the Kamias Road area, he (Vila who is a classmate of Corpus as well as Ferronil of class 1967) being blindfolded. When his blindfold was removed, they were in a house of Castro, Jose Maria Sison, Macahiya and others. Corpus claimed he left the AFP because he was discriminated against (not allowed to take the Intelligence Course) the Floring Crisologo incident when he was berated openly for saying that the only solution to the peace and order program in locos Sur would be the killing of Floring Crisologo, and his cavalier treatment in the PMA.<br>
Vila revealed the meeting with Corpus to Gen. Ordoñez as he could not sleep with the secret. But Lt. Ferronil was not informed of the revelation and when he was asked he denied the meeting with Corpus.<br>
But the assessment is that Vila is telling the truth. A Lt. Enriquez and Lt. Sibal are also vocally in favor of the action taken by Corpus and may be in touch with him<br>
I have asked the Price Control Council to bring down the Villegas rate or increase of 2 centavos per liter of standard gasoline to 1 centavo. I asked Atty. Lupino Lazaro to move for reconsideration of the decision of the Price Control Council to uphold the Villegas rate and to thus have the credit of this victory for the drivers. He has agreed. The arrangements are being made with USec. Bung Tanco.<br>
But the striking drivers and the students supporting them (among them the Kabataan Makabayan and Father Blanco’s SKIT) are going to march around the city and start violence.<br>
Tonight they have started to stone even private cars. It is expected that it will be worse tomorrow.<br>
But the Metrocom, reinforced by three companies, are ready for any eventuality.<br>
This is probably the beginning of the intensified activities of the KM’s and NPAs and CPP for 1971.<br>
We will keep watching for the need of the use of emergency powers.<br>
I have a report of Customs anomalies which have been confirmed. I attach it.<br>
So I must expedite the Customs reorganization.<br>
Activists, radicals, rioters, demonstrators and the IMB’s and PA’s do not now constitute a serious threat to our society. This is the sober judgment that I arrive at after long and serious study.<br>
Even if the government were to help them mount a rebellion, they would still be nothing but harassing groups incapable of taking over government.<br>
But they pose in the minds of businessmen and prospective investors a fear of rebellion and a consequent insecurity of investment and economic activity. This fear must be dissipated.<br>

Tuesday<br>
We have been delayed by the blackout at about 9:00 PM which blanketed not only Metropolitan Manila but all provinces up to Tarlac in the north and up to Laguna in the south.<br>
I was then at dinner with Dr. Zahvkar who is here on the IMF consultations as we ask for more liberal credit and concessional loans. He is very sympathetic but cautious because of the effect of too much credit on the rate of exchange.<br>
And Atty. Lupino Lazaro was having dinner at the State Dining Room waiting for me. I convinced him that since I had earlier directed the oil refineries to lower the Villegas rate of standard gasoline from the increase of two centavos to one centavo and organized the Presidential Oil Commission to look into the profits of the oil refineries and the bus and jeepney operators as well as the drivers, he should not allow the drivers to participate in the rally and demonstrators which is being led by the Kabataang Makabayan and the NPA. But he would or could not call off the strike. He feels that the people are on their side. But after the lowering of the gasoline rates, he will lose the people’s support gradually,<br>
But Nering Andolong reports that the blackout or power failure was deliberately done to test strength and cause confusion. We are still investigating. The Meralco explanation that a truck struck an electric post was not plausible because even the substation in Pampanga exploded.<br>
Nering Andolong also reports that Renato Constantino, I.P. Soliongco and Angel Baking organized the more than seventy student leaders that saw Mr. Eugenio Lopez, the “evil genius” of the Lopez group – apparently for financing for the rally tomorrow.<br>
Freddie Elizalde showed me a copy of an editorial which Chino Roces wanted to be pooled by all the newspapers castigating me and asking for my resignation and that of the cabinet. For good measure the editorial included the Vice President. It was opposed by Freddie and Ugarte. And Teddy Locsin opposed the demand for resignation.<br>
What a ridiculous spectacle Chino Roces is making of himself. He is supposed to have said that I engineered the drivers’ strike and am leading to a declaration of martial law as there will be violence tomorrow and in the days to come. And he predicted that at least ten men would be killed tomorrow. He (Chino Roces) and the rest of them (IP Soliongco, Renato Constantino and Angel Baking) probably know or feel that they will be arrested in the event I proclaim martial law.<br>
My suspicion is that Ambassador Byroade may have leaked my statement that in the event of massive sabotage or terrorism I would use my extraordinary powers. His wife whom he did not bring with him to the U.S. told me she is going to Subic Naval Base instead of Baguio her favorite vacation place allegedly because it is too cold.<br>
The timetable is being pushed too fast by the leftists. It may be earlier than we think.<br>
Gen. Yan, Sec. Enrile and the others recommend the relief of Gen. Paredes of the Ind PC Zone and to assign Col. Ver there. But he is loyal and a good combat officer. He can be depended upon to use his initiative.<br>
So I am retaining him. But I will elevate Col. Ver to Senior Aide de Camp.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2693" data-line-end="2695">I am creating the Intelligence Command and putting Gen. Fidel Ramos in command. His deputy, Col. Sibayan, takes over the III Inf. Brigade.<br>

The congressmen close to me, Cong. Cojuangco, Frisco San Juan, Ali Dimaporo, Jose Aspiras, Navarro, Lucas Canton, Roque Ablan all pressed for the use of my emergency powers. “We cannot understand why you are so patient. Do not wait until we are completely debilitated and the people is against us. It will be too late. One swift blow and we remove the cancer from our society,” they all said.<br>
I could only answer that it may be sooner than we think.<br>
For violence erupted in Plaza Miranda and other places in the city this afternoon up to tonight. Confirmed casualties are 14 injured including one policeman and two troopers hit by molotov cocktails (which cocktails according to Gen. Ordoñez were twice the force of a hand grenade) and one confirmed killed and another possibly killed.<br>
Atty. Lupino Lazaro who called me up while I was having dinner with the congressmen at about 9:30 PM claimed the drivers were not involved as he dispersed them at 2:00 PM and the violence started at 5:00 PM which was true. But the radical left, mostly students, did take over from the drivers. Lazaro sent Bert Moran to explain to me<br>
that he will try to stop the strike tomorrow.<br>
I made an appeal for the media not to farther exacerbate passions, to report fairly and honestly. I begged the pressure groups who are reported to be financing and egging them to violence to desist in the name of the people, for the communists are taking advantage of the chaos and confusion.<br>
I attach my outline and the report of Adrian Cristobal on the publishers’ meeting at Meralco yesterday.<br>

The poor people of Tondo, our slum area, came over to Malacañang at 4:00 PM to pledge loyalty to me in the fight against the oligarchs. Students, activists, laborers and intellectuals were there.<br>
We could make this the rallying cry, “Fight the oligarchs who suppress our people!”<br>
And make it a nationwide movement. The cry is catching fire. For one thing the word “oligarch” is in everybody’s lips.<br>
“No compromise. No turning back. Let us now reform our society. Let us give true equality.”<br>
I intend to propose a strong anti-trust law to break up the big monopolies and the combines that dictate prices and depress the people. The monopolies or combines are in sugar, rice, copra, flour, steel, textiles and cement.<br>
And I intend to propose a radical plan of profit sharing and a new concept of ownership of private property,<br>
Slowly the issues are clarifying as I dissociate myself from the oligarchs, some of whom are our friends.<br>
These oligarchs as meant in this case are the families that remain powerful and influential no matter who are the persons or parties in power.<br>
The symbol of these oligarchs are the Lopezes who have always struck terror into the hearts of government men.<br>
I convinced the oil executives, Mr. Wallahan and Wales accompanied by Francis Ablan to accept the roll-back to the rates and prices of oil commodities as of January 6th before the Villegas committee set a 2 centavo increase for regular gasoline and issued an order to the Price Control Council to this effect – effective one week within which time the Price Control Council should set the prices with the regular gasoline kept at a low level even if the premium gasoline should be increased by five centavos. I attach the order.<br>
I opened the Japanese Floating Trade Fair on the “Sakura Manu” at 6:15 PM with Imelda.<br>

I met with all the leaders of organized labor with 27 federation heads present. They committed themselves to the unrelenting fight against the oligarchs, the freezing of regular gasoline prices even if premium gas is increased, the lowering of Meralco rates which were increased by the Public Service Commission headed by Com. Medina, the dismantling of monopolies, combinations and cartels that control prices, the passage of a strong anti-trust law and the review of franchises that give special privileges and more social justice legislation.<br>
But they asked everyone, including myself, that there be a common pledge of no withdrawal from the fight. “Patayin ang umurong!” Which we did solemnly.<br>
Now we tie up all the farmers’ organizations and the Socialist Party under Lacsina.<br>
The Acting Chairman of the group was Roberto Oca, President of the Pinagbuklod na Manggagawa g Pilipinas and the Acting Secretary, Tony Policarpio the Vice President of Atty. Lerum in the Cipriano Cid was represented by Atty. Israel Bocobo.<br>
The labor leaders left Malacañang to meet outside so that it may not be said that they were herded and dictated to in Malacanang. Then they returned to present the resolution to me.<br>
I attach the resolutions of the labor leaders.<br>
After a conference with Justice Antonio Barredo, former Solicitor General who handled the increase of Meralco fares for the government, with Sol. Gen. Felix Antonio and Sec. of Justice Vicente Abad Santos, as well as Solicitor who is handling the case now, we have decided that Com. Evangelista will order the Auditor General to look into the books of Meralco to determine their income under the increased rates, then on the basis of the new facts and the fact now discovered by me (from Justice Barredo) that the motion for reconsideration was never tried by the Public Service Commission en banc and therefore cannot be appealable, the Public Service Commission will ask the Supreme Court to which the increase was appealed, to allow the Public Service Commission to reassess the rates anew.<br>
Also met the CAA squatters who came to Malacañang to reaffirm their support for me in the fight against the oligarchs.<br>
I attach pictures of these.<br>

Sunday<br>
Meralco, thru Emilio Abello, issued yesterday a statement claiming the President was wasting his time on insignificant matters apparently referring to my fight on the oligarchy.<br>
The labor groups invited into a common front with Bert Oca of Pinagbuklod and Tony Policarpio answered it today with the statement that the matter of prices raised by Meralco rates and monopolies or pressure groups are not insignificant and affect millions of people.<br>
I directed, in writing, the Dept. of Justice, Solicitor General and Public Service Commission to study the reopening of the question of Meralco rates. We discovered that the motion for reconsideration of the Solicitor General supposed to be acted upon in banc was never resolved by the Public Service Commission and therefore, there is no final judgment that can be appealed to by the Supreme Court. Then again the question of fact as to the alleged excessive income of the Maralco on the basis of the new dates should be decided by the Public Service Commission now that these rates have been collected actually by Meralco.<br>
So the Public Service Commission, tomorrow, orders the Auditor General to continue the unfinished audit of the books of Meralco and to further determine the actual income under the new rates.<br>
Additional pledges of support in the fight against the oligarchs continue to pour in. The Market Vendors’ Association under Poly Cayetano (20,000 strong) came this afternoon to offer support.<br>
Governor Cipriano Primicias of Pangasinan came to explain how he has issued a statement that while he is neutral in the fight between the President and Lopez, the continuous and unbridled attack on the President by the Chronicle and the ABS-CBN shows that it is guided by one hand. It also shows the existence of an empire within the republic which answers to no one no matter what abuses they commit while the President is accountable to the people.<br>
He is calling the Directorate of the Governor’s League (30 members) to act on a resolution of support.<br>
And Gov. Conrado Estrella called back to say he has been working on the farmer groups to obtain resolutions of support.<br>
Tomorrow, the congressmen’s resolution will be signed.<br>
But the Lopez camp is talking of impeachment.<br>

We have decided to call a demonstration of our own to take over the space at the Congress on the 25th when the leftist radicals intend to cause trouble. We hope to place 100,000 people to displace the trouble makers and thus avoid violence.<br>
I have also accepted the decision of the House of Representatives to set the opening ceremonies and my State of the Nation Address at 1100 AM. There are all kinds of rumours flying around: one says a grenade will be thrown at me and my car; another is to the effect that a photographer may be the would-be assassin; the radicals are preparing strike forces who will hit back at the police; snipers will be posted at the tall buildings; Congress will be besieged for three days, etc.<br>
The Solicitor General reports that the Public Service Commission never acted in banc on the motion for reconsideration; the provisional rates appealed on a petition for certiorari is the basis for the new rates charged by Meralco. The final decision is under the law unenforceable while on appeal. So if the appeal of the provisional rates is withdrawn, then there would be no basis for the new rates being charged.<br>
I have left the matter to the Secretary of Justice and the Solicitor General.<br>
The Auditor General when asked to conduct an audit of the Meralco books of accounts claimed that they had finished the audit of the books May or June last year. He acts suspiciously.<br>
Atty. Jose Mirante, who practices in the Public Service Commission reports that one million pesos was given to Com. Medina and each of the four Associate Commissioners ₱250,000.00 each. And each of the four commissioners now receive an amount of ₱20,000 annually.<br>
So we may have to file criminal or administrative cases against them.<br>
Today I order the Presidential Economic Staff to list down the monopolies, combinations, trusts and cartels so we can dismantle them.<br>
I have directed a general study of rates reduction of all public utilities including the Phil. Long Distance Co. and the transportation companies.<br>
I enclose the directives.<br>

Tuesday<br>
This is a strange situation we are facing. The radicals who wish to overthrow government are allied with the oligarchies who want to preserve their privileges.<br>
This is confirmed by Atty. Lupino Lazaro who narrated how the radicals, Eric Baculinao, Crispin Aranda, Clemente and the moderates headed by NUSP’s Jopson met at the ABS-CBN press room mapping out strategy. And he was castigated by them for sending away the drivers at 2:00 PM on Jan. 13th before the violence started.<br>
Again Atty. Bonifacio de Luna of the Philippine Confederation of Drivers further confirmed this tonight.<br>
And he added the information that Atty. Lazaro is after nothing but money. He promised de Luna 1/3 of what he makes.<br>
So Lazaro and the other leader Geruero are going to block the amicable settlement of the gasoline price problem unless they are paid. And we should not permit this.<br>
Lazaro asked ₱300,000 and came all the way down to ₱100,000 according to Atty. Siguion Reyna on the evening of June 12th before the demonstrations of June 13th.<br>
But I have asked Atty. de Luna to separate from the Lazaro and Geruero group and we will extend him all aid to organize a cooperative. At the same time we will ask the oil companies to see to it that the ₱5 million trust fund should not look as if they are the source of the money as the drivers will not accept it. And ₱1 million should be set aside for the organization of cooperatives.<br>
The price of regular gasoline should be kept at the present level but premium can be raised provided that steps should be taken to limit the sale of regular gasoline at present prices to public utilities only.<br>
I also met the oil executives to get them to agree to settle the matter of gasoline prices quietly without of course discontinuing the hearings of the Price Control Council.<br>
We should not talk of extending the period of seven days to work out an agreement before we have exhausted all efforts to do so. Bung Tanco will first meet with the drivers’ leaders to find out what is acceptable to them then submit it to the oil executives.<br>
I had the senators (Nacionalista) for lunch this noon. Everyone attended except Sen. Jose Diokno who is a retainer of Lopez and Sen. Pres. Gil Puyat and Mamintal Tamano who are in Indonesia. Present were Sen. Arturo Tolentino, Lorenzo Tañada, Sen Pres. Pro Tempore Jose Roy, Eva Estrada Kalaw, Leonardo Perez, Dominador Aytona, Lorenzo Teves, Rene Espina, Salvador Laurel, Lorenzo Sumulong, Ambrosio Padilla, Wenceslao Lagumbay, Alejandro Almendras and Helen Benitez.<br>
They were unanimously in favor of trade with Russia, three were in favor of diplomatic relations (Tañnda, Laurel and Teves who was even in favor of diplomatic relations with Red China) and three in favor of trade and consular relations (which would not include diplomatic immunity). These last three were Sumulong who suggested it, Roy and Kalaw.<br>
Sen. Arturo Tolentino repeated his observation he had made in the caucus of congressional leaders that the people may not be ready for it; that everybody he talked to were against it because of fear of Russian infiltration; that we could go at it by stages.<br>
When I asked Tanada on the Lopez imbroglio he commented, “Just follow the law.”<br>
We agreed on priorities on the legislative program – import ban on luxuries, agricultural reform by cooperatives, affluent consumption tax, oil commission, oil prospecting, national or state trading corporation.<br>
Commander Melody was captured last night by Lt. Col. Gatan, Provincial Commander of Tarlac, and his men at Valenzuela, Bulacan with the aid of Boy Car Sison who was captured in Tarlac several davs earlier. When surrounded and faced with a cocked pistol he offered no resistance. The boys of Cong. Eduardo Cojuangco helped.<br>
We have not announced the capture as we are going to use Commander Melody who is next in rank only to Commander Dante, to capture both Jose Maria Sison and Dante.<br>
I personally made him pledge to this mission with his family held as guarantors.<br>
Imelda is busy organizing our supporters and leaders to bring delegations of five, ten and twenty thousand people to fill up the safety belt around Congress on the 25th, to keep the radicals away and show that we have the support of the people in our drive against the oligarchies and robber barons.<br>

Imee and Irene have been permitted to stay in the palace under a tutor doing their homework and taking the exams of Assumption College but not attending classes there because of the threat of kidnapping against them.<br>
Imelda and I talked to Father Dominic about the plot to kidnap Bongbong by some Cairo Muslims, possibly Filipinos. The information came from Jimmy Rafferty of the U.S. Embassy who got it from his or their Tausog agents. Kokoy Romualdez has notified Scotland Yard about the plot. And the English government is taking all precaution.<br>
The Liberals have taken a full-page advertisement on martial law declaring they would not attend sessions if martial law is declared.<br>
I have had to reiterate my stand that martial law is the last recourse – that I would resort to it only if there is massive sabotage, terrorism, assassination and/or violent grab for control of government.<br>
The students led by Eric Baculinao, Gerry Barican and Nelson Navarro met Sec. Ernesto Maceda on their initiative and wanted ground rules established on the demonstration on the 25th.<br>
But they would not meet with Sec. Juan Ponce Enrile except in the U.P. so there has been no meeting with them of the committee I organized of Sec. Enrile, Gen. Ordoñez and Col. Ver to meet with them.<br>
I attach the note of Sec. Maceda on this.<br>
The students are getting split. I attach the campus editorial and news clipping on this.<br>
The Nica spot report is quite accurate. I attach it.<br>
The farmers from Central Luzon under Max Fabian and Luis Taruc came to offer support to me. I enclose their resolution.<br>
Lacsina of the Socialist Party insisted that we should dissociate ourselves from the IMF and just notify the American creditors that we cannot pay and let them collect.<br>
I told him I thought that he was afraid of the oligarchs and the newspapers. Because from my point of view he was giving a transparent excuse for his avoiding being identified with us.<br>
But apparently he is playing for bigger stakes. He wants his socialist philosophy adopted.<br>
The cause that we are now fighting is God-sent. And we now should work on the things that will immediately give relief to the masses of our people specially the lowering of the Meralco rates.<br>
I meet the Solicitor General on this tomorrow.<br>
Am now working on the State of the Nation address.<br>

“Go after the communists and their cells in all areas of activity. There must be no abuse of power. We must show restraint and responsibility. We must allow the functions of government to function normally under military supervision. The operations must be swift and clean. After the objective is attained then, the authority must be returned to the civil government.”<br>
“If we do not have enough men to take over all the media then we should close all the newspapers and television and radio stations leaving one of each only to communicate to the people.”<br>
“Even if I am not there, follow the contingency plan unerringly and with resolution.”<br>
“If I should be unconscious, I must be revived so I can sign the proclamation. And even if I cannot actively command, my plans must be followed.”<br>
These were my orders to Sec. Ponce Enrile, Gen. Yan, Gen. Espino, Gen. Ileto, Gen. Ramos and Col. Ver this evening at 7:30 PM to 9:00 PM during the conference on the contingency plan.<br>
I attach a disturbing report which reflects on the character of Gen. Yan, Com. Lavadia and Gen. Perez.<br>
So now we must strengthen the staff of Gen. Espino to watch over the movements of Gen. Yan and control the message center in GHQ.<br>
There was a fire at the City Hall which started at the room of Judge Asuncion from an overheated electric fan.<br>
The drivers’ leaders could not agree on a quiet solution of the oil products prices. I met them (de Luna, Geruero and Lupino Lazaro) this noon up to 1:30 from 12:30.<br>
I also met the Public Service Commission at Pangarap before that and they have decided to hear the Motion for Reconsideration of the Meralco rates on Jan. 28th.<br>
It looks like the students may have called off their demonstration in Congress so that as they say, “Marcos will have no reason to proclaim martial law.”<br>
Tony Policarpio called up at about 11:00 PM to tell me that the labor leaders have decided to send a delegation to Congress on the 25th although Tony Diaz and Eddie Nolasco of Philcontu registered votes against the plan.<br>

While everybody has been saying that the demonstration on Monday, Jan. 25th would be peaceful, tonight the Esso building at Marques de Comillas was completely burned and one man inside killed (after an explosion), the Caltex building at Roxas Boulevard was damaged severely in its front by a bomb with two men slightly injured and a Pandacan gasoline station also bombed. I attach report.<br>
Had a briefing at the Intelligence and GHQ at which later briefing of the National Security Council, I had an unpleasant incident with Minority Floor Leader Justiniano Montano who in his usual arrogant way was denouncing me and the administration, bragging about his courage and insulting me personally. When I rebuked him for this calling his attention to the fact that this was an objective presentation where we should not interject politics, he became more overbearing and agitated.<br>
Sen. Gerardo Roxas also took umbrage on my remarks that the Liberals were over-reacting to the statements on martial law when those were made to prevent violence.<br>
We finally settled down to a calmer session when I wisecracked about our quarreling about nothing.<br>
Cagayan and Zambales came to pledge loyalty with their governors.<br>
I worked on my State of the Nation address. Much too long.<br>
Imelda has been busy the whole day and is suffering from a pain in the right lumbar. Dr. Gloria Aragon says it may be her old kidney ailment as her kidney may have gone down because of her slimming program. She has been advised to stop her dieting and to rest.<br>

Saturday<br>
I have finished the last draft of my State of the Nation address of about 113 printed or typewritten pages. But as usual the reading copy will be about 15 pages long for a 30 minute delivery.<br>
The bombing of Esso and Caltex buildings were headlined in the morning papers. Esso burned as the dynamite used had a bottle of gasoline with it – apparently home-made. Crude and bulky but effective.<br>
I attach the report on it by J-2.<br>
After a meeting with Sec. Ponce Enrile, Gens. Yan, Ileto, Garcia and Ramos and Col. Ver, I have a feeling that the Congressional opening and rally on the 25th will be peaceful. But the NPA or CPP who are suspected to have done the bombing are expected to continue and may do so at targets other than Congress. It may be Malacañang. Or any of the other public buildings<br>
I met Andy Soriano and Sebastian Ugarte of the Herald this morning. I explained that the fight against the oligarchs was not against bigness but against the use of bigness to oppress our people and intimidate the public officials for more financial gain.<br>
He seemed relieved but still worried about anarchy. I had to assure him when I called him back alone that if the situation deteriorates, I may have to use my extraordinary powers like declaring martial law. He seemed relieved and said, “You would be surprised at the number of people who would welcome it.”<br>
I explained that I was willing to negotiate with the moderates but the NPA and CPP would want nothing short of taking over the government.<br>
However I emphasized the need for reform, for an anti-trust law, for cooperatives, for a more equitable redistribution of wealth.<br>
I even suggested a meeting with businessmen to whom I could explain the whole thing again – and even a meeting with Chino Roces afterwards.<br>
But I called his attention to the fact that there was not one among those in media. saying anything about or against communism. And we must now.<br>
So I obtained his pledge to use the Herald against communism which is our common foe.<br>

I could not write my diary last night as we were occupied by the State of the Nation address and the developments of the evening.<br>
Mayor Antonio Villegas, after meeting with the KM, decided to remove the barriers of about 20 meters between the space allotted to the radical SDK and MDP and the pro-administration demonstrators. He also said that he was pulling out the policemen out of the area and indicated that he would allow the radical demonstrators to set up a human blockade of the driveway northward out of the congressional premises preventing anyone including my car from leaving the building. And Villegas threatened to order the Metrocom out of the premises.<br>
So it became necessary for Sec. Ponce Enrile to issue written orders to Gen. Ordoñez, the CG of the Metrocom, to implement OPLAN TANUD or Lawmaker, to secure Congress, the first family, members of Congress and their guests as well as the rallyists.<br>
This was done at about midnight.<br>
Later I swore in the new colonels of our Armed Forces (about 118 of them) at about 1:00 AM.<br>
Slept at about 2:00 PM and woke up this morning at 7:00 AM.<br>

Monday<br>
This is the turning point. The congressional opening and State of the Nation address ceremonies were peaceful<br>
And the whole nation heaved a sigh of relief. For many had left for the provinces and for abroad to avoid the imagined dangers of a revolution.<br>
Chino Roces, Manglapus and the radicals who have been predicting the start of a revolution today must be disappointed.<br>
As usual Mayor Villegas was claiming he was the cause of it all. But he came down from his tower of City Hall only when he realized that there was going to be no trouble. I am sure others will follow suit tomorrow.<br>
Actually what prevented violence was the predominance of the pro-administration demonstrators. But not just pro-Marcos but pro-Democratic Revolution that I launched in my speech.<br>
The radicals lost heart when they saw the determination of the veterans, the market vendors, the provincial delegations and the spectators. Some of the students and radicals who tried to infiltrate the pro-administration delegations were shooed away.<br>
My State of the Nation Address has been received enthusiastically even by the opposition. Even Cong. Montano congratulated me with the statement that he agreed with me and liked the speech. Sen. Ninoy Aquino when asked to comment on it said he agreed with the program and the rhetoric but doubted implementation. This was the theme of the Liberals.<br>
I attach the speech with the ad libs.<br>
We must push through the Democratic Revolution to its logical conclusion.<br>
And treat everyone with a fair and even hand – friend and foe alike. In this we must be merciless but just.<br>
Now I attend to the constitutional convention to convince the delegates about my proposals. For it will be they who must permanently restructure our social order.<br>

Tuesday<br>
Had the governors and city mayors for lunch at the State Dining room.<br>
In my speech I spoke of the brotherhood between all Filipinos during the euphoria of independence in 1946; how that brotherhood was lost by the materialism of the next twenty five years and how we must again reestablish it.<br>
But there has been no rallying cause for the majority of our people who desire for such a brotherhood and unity. Now the rallying cause is the Democratic Revolution.<br>
My voice alone is weak. But you must spread this gospel. For you are the men who are in actual touch with the people.<br>
Let us give the Democratic Revolution validity with our acts.<br>
In the dinner we tendered for the leaders of the pro-administration demonstrators, I repeated the same thing.<br>
I commended them all. Bert Oca and Tony Policarpio of the Pinagbuklod, Poly Cayetano of the Chamber of Retailers and market vendors, Ali Dimaporo and his Muslims, Uging Navarro and his Mindanawenos, Miling Barbero and his Abraeños, Lucas Canton and his locos Sur boys, Joe Aspiras and Titing Ortega as well as Tancred Guray with the La Union boys, Condring Estrella and the Pangasinanses, the Tarlac boys under Tony Diaz although actually Danding Cojuangco was the leader, the Pampangueños under Gov. Nepomuceno, the Bulacan delegation under Gov. Santiago, Nueva Viscaya under Leone Perez, then the veterans under Marking, Frisco San Juan, Simeon Medalla, the Metrocom under Gen. Ordoñez, the Marine Batallion under newly promoted Col. Brown, the Tabak Batallion under newly promoted Col. dela Cruz, the Navy and Air Force – the evacuation by helicopter under newly promoted Col. Lapena, Com. Edu, Luis Illera, Guimo de Vega, Romy Diaz and Malang.<br>
The morale is high and they all say, “Let us do it again.”<br>
Igor Pa________ the Russian tagalista studying in the UP confidentially told Cong. Barbero: “The only true revolutionary here is Marcos. No revolution will succeed here as the rebels have no organization, no rallying cause and no leader and above all they have not been able to neutralize or demoralize the Armed Forces.”<br>
Apparently he is watching my own revolution.<br>

Wednesday<br>
There is still an atmosphere of hopeful expectancy for the Democratic Revolution. The greater number of our people are happy about the peaceful turn of events. And there has been a complete turn-about.<br>
Indicative of this is the new attitude of Charlie Palanca, President of Lepanto Mining. In a party, Heny Lopez Jr. was bitterly castigating me and the administration when Charlie Palanca asked him: “Alright, so you do not like Marcos. Who would take his place? And so there is none who could take his place? Then let us quit talking. Let us<br>
work for our country.”<br>
And the manager of ABS-CBN Almeda-Lopez when asked over television why the pro administration calls on the telephone to the show of Radio Patrol and other ABS-CBN programs were not being entertained, had to admit that 80% of the calls were pro-Marcos and that the silent majority is beginning to speak.<br>
I met with the egalitarian intellectuals of the UP tonight, Cesar Majul, Ruben Santos, Bonifacio and Almonte.<br>
They are all enthusiastic about the Democratic Revolution. Now we have to reduce the theory and ideal into practical programs that can be implemented<br>
They have practical suggestions like a check by visitors to government offices in a suggestion slip to be given to either the immediate superior or a group of assessors or lower-ranking Ombudsman.<br>
And reactivation of media to inform the people of what the government is doing.<br>
Then to improve the atmosphere of the lower echelon government officers and employees that are in direct contact with the people. Bonifacio referred to the discourtesy and inattention of the employees of the LTC when he went to that office for the renewal of his driver’s license.<br>
They report that the UP professors are saying the State of the Nation address will bring the people behind the President.<br>
I have called a cabinet meeting next Saturday to receive the plans of the cabinet members to implement the Democratic Revolution.<br>
Although we expect a demonstration on this day as it is the 30th.<br>
The men who spread the story that a revolution would start on January 25 must be very red in the face.<br>
Like Manglapus who had appeared on TV every 30 minutes on Channel 2 in dolorous tones warning: “Stay at home. On Jan. 25th, stay off the streets.”<br>
Father Fritz Araneta, the Father Rector of Ateneo de Manila, was practically disauthorized for his warning through the media to stay away and to expect a revolution. Father de la Costa, Father Cruz, Father Doherty and almost all the Jesuit fathers agreed with Father Doherty who said: “Your announcement was neither scholarly nor Christian.”<br>

Thursday<br>
Met about 25 of the leading businessmen of the country in a merienda hosted by Andy Soriano at his Forbes Park home this afternoon at 4:00-6:00 PM.<br>
I informed them that the communists or subversives were slowly sapping the vitality of our country; that the communists are presently in no position to start a rebellion or a revolution but in two years or three there would probably be no need for a revolution, the communists would merely take over – or the military.<br>
But my democratic revolution offers an alternative or option. So I asked that it be supported to abort a communist take-over.<br>
Bert Villanueva said they were all for my objectives but what were the specifics.<br>
Jess Cabarrus repeated his idea of more money in circulation to put more men under employment. Not too many were in accord with him. He had said that we have only ₱4 billion in circulation. Yet we have a capacity to produce exports worth ₱1 billion. So we should have twenty or thirty billion pesos in circulation. Specially since we must get more people employed in a short time.<br>
Ramon del Rosario complained that the atmosphere of investment must be hospitable. But there is no rule as to what is reasonable profit. “Profit has become a bad word.” Of course he was referring to the roll back in the prices of regular gasoline and kerosene which just about wipes out his Filoil.<br>
Tony Roxas Chua recommended that the Singapore Investment Incentives law be duplicated in the Philippines.<br>
Sen. Pres. Gil Puyat felt that there should be more meetings and conferences with the private sector. He felt that the recommended taxes are regressive and could be passed to the consumer (Development tax or foreign exchange tax, affluent consumption tax and higher inheritance tax). David Sycip answered that would be alright if the ones who paid were the ultimate consumer.<br>
Don Manolo Elizalde started the exchange of views after my opening statement to the effect that it was not my intention to go after any particular businessman or corporation.<br>
Ting Rojas told me in confidence that some investors had postponed their decisions to invest until May because of the fact that the consultative group of the U.S., Japan and Australia with some observers would be set up in Paris on April 26th<br>
David Sycip farther suggested that the best way to attract investment would be to create a market – Asean because our own Philippine market is too small.<br>
We had talked about this in the past and Ting Paterno told them of the arrangements we are trying to make with the other Asian countries.<br>
We expect some violence and trouble in the next several days because of a jeepney strike and the January 30th anniversary of the 1970 Mendiola incident.<br>
Atty. Lupino Lazaro has announced a strike of the Pasang-Mazda jeepney drivers beginning tomorrow evening at 6:30 PM because only regular gasoline and kerosene were kept at their old levels. He claims it is nation-wide and that he has wired everyone of their affiliates at Cotabato City, Naga, Bacolod etc.; and that they are prepared to hold a strike longer than the first one.<br>
A second fire in the Dept. of Justice has burned some more records of cases under investigation.<br>
I have directed that the German loan of about $14 million include not only ports like the Free Trade Zone, San Fernando, La Union but also the conversion of Zamboanga Airport into an International Airport as the flow of plane traffic seems to be Tokyo, Hongkong and Bangkok, Manila, Zamboanga (if DC-8’s can land there), Bali, Australia, New Zealand, Fiji Islands, Honolulu and San Francisco, Los Angeles.<br>

Worked on the reconstruction, PACD, infrastructure and agricultural recovery program.<br>
I had the secretary of finance, the secretary of public works, the commissioner of the budget, commissioner on Highways and the BOI chairman.<br>
Am not contented with the listing of projects. There are delays in implementation -the PES has taken 3 months to act on the PJ (Phil. Japan Highway) program<br>
So I have insisted on a PACD project in every barrio, a highway project in every province, 2,750 school buildings, hospitals and irrigation projects.<br>
The agricultural program should include cooperatives. I have started an experimental cooperative farm of the Moshav type in Llavera, Nueva Ecija.<br>
50,000 patents and titles will be given this year to small farmers by the Bureau of Lands.<br>
The situation becomes more tense as the Pasang Masa of Atty. Lupino Lazaro announced that their strike has been postponed to Monday. Lazaro is apparently weakening.<br>
This time we take a firmer stand and we arrest anyone harassing vehicles on the road instead of just driving them away.<br>
Neither the oil companies nor the drivers are content with the provisional decision.<br>
But now the greater number of our people are alienated by the drivers as the PCC grant what they have originally been after.<br>
This afternoon, I asked Sec. Ponce Enrile and Gen. Yan to delay to July the taking in as enlisted men the 1,300 new men (trainees) for the 1st Inf. Div. (Tabak) but to extend their training to June 30th. Thus we save ₱3.2 million.<br>
We will spend the money for the PACD.<br>
And we prepare a dummy contingency plan where we mass the troops for Central Luzon instead of Manila – thus mislead the subversives who seem to have an inkling of the original IISMA plan.<br>
I pointed out the deficiency of the Intelligence on penetration which must now be intensified. As well as the inadequacy of our efforts on psy-war.<br>
We sent 500 guns to Isabela for the BSDU’s to be put up. The 10th BCT has been sent there and they have killed or apprehended subversives some of whom have given information which has led to the dismantling of the cadres set up by the NPA.<br>
More and more, we feel that the CP and NPA will resort to sabotage and terrorism as in desperation they are outwitted and thwarted in every turn.<br>
In Congress they are still complaining about the guards and military men set up in the premises. We have kept quiet and we do not reveal to them that we know some of them (Ninoy Aquino and Ramon Mitra Jr.) were in the know about the plot that was called off because of the strict screening of all persons entering the building and the House Session Hall – to hand grenade all the leaders there present (the Vice President, Senate Pres., Speaker, Chief Justice and me).<br>
Neither have we revealed the fact that we caught a man with grenades. His companions sneaked away.<br>
I have ordered the expediting of the oil exploration of the concessionaires. Oriental Oil asked for $2.4 million and the approval of its contract for drilling. I ordered Sec. Tanco to approve it today and Sec. Virata to have it approved on Tuesday so that they can meet their Feb. 10th deadline. Otherwise they lose their right to this only offshore drilling rig in the area of South East Asia left uncontracted for.<br>
The drilling starts next March at the Palawan shelf.<br>

Saturday<br>
The cabinet meeting to which were invited the heads of offices and agencies came off very well.<br>
We initiate the written criticism and checking of the conduct of public officials by citizens who visit their offices.<br>
And the specific projects have been worked out: Housing – ₱300 million from the SSS and GSIS; the national electrification program – ₱600 million; the Naceda, Dept. of Labor program for mass employment in cottage industries; the land title distribution program (50,000 titles this year); land reform by cooperatives.<br>
We agreed on the first priority – reform the bureaucracy specially at the points of contact with the people like licensing offices.<br>
Not only courtesy but efficiency so as to give the people that the officials are their servants.<br>
I have created a Presidential Performance Task Force headed by Executive Secretary Alex Melchor.<br>
The cabinet meeting starting at 10:30 AM ended about 2:00 PM.<br>
All the while the radical KM groups were demonstrating in front of Malacañan (about 1,000 only).<br>
There has been no violence in the demonstrations this day which is supposed to be the anniversary of the Jan. 30, 1970 violent demonstrations when four died.<br>
But more PC men are being fielded in Tarlac as the PA has become more active there. One BSDU unit apparently has been taken over by them and the two non- commissioned PC men supervisors murdered. There are more assasinations.<br>
Commander Melody has submitted his first report that the CPP has had a reorganization. Sison is still head, No. 2 is Nilo Tayag, No. 3 is Lt. Victor Corpus who takes the place of Arthur Garcia, deceased. Dante retains his command of the NPA.<br>
A report has just come in from Metrocom that some KM are in Tondo and Malabon planning to come up the Pasig behind Malacañan and prepared to bomb the palace from that unprotected side.<br>
But the patrol boats and security are prepared for them.<br>
The City Mayors came to pledge their total and complete support for the Democratic Revolution.<br>
The governors have done likewise.<br>
The local officials are now enthusiastic and prepared to openly fight communism.<br>
The Senate as usual is still wasting time on privilege speeches and threats of impeachment and overriding my<br>
veto of the bill of automatic releases of the Congressional and Judicial appropriations.<br>
And so with the newspapers. All news are slanted to criticize and denigrate me.<br>
So we will have to activate our old propaganda machinery – audio-visual units, TV and radio programs and news-making for a purpose.<br>
A master program should give to our men in the field our position on any current question.<br>

Sunday<br>
The Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan and other local governments are preparing for the jeepney drivers’ strike.<br>
Metrocom with support units will back up the local police.<br>
It is now the plan to arrest those who block traffic or sabotage operating units. This will be a reversal of the policy of tolerance even of violence.<br>
But of course in the first strike of the drivers, it was awkward to be on the side of the monopolists – the oil executives. But now that we have rolled back the price of regular gasoline and kerosene, we are on the right side. And the leader of the strikers, Atty. Lupino Lazaro, has turned into nothing but a blackmailer. He asked Atty. Siguion Reyna ₱300,000, asked me of ₱35,000 for the conversion of his garage into a headquarters for his union and later demanded half a million pesos for a building to house his union with him running the whole show of course.<br>
I do not believe the strike can paralyze traffic.<br>
Latest reports are that Jose Maria Sison has sent two men to liquidate me and Imelda. They are seeking the aid of radical students.<br>
Laguna and Cavite radicals are on the same mission.<br>
The men’s identities are unknown.<br>
The CPP and NPA are now getting desperate and they will probably be resorting to sabotage, assassination and terrorism.<br>
We must prepare for it.<br>
Gave merienda to the League of Governors and City Mayors. Spoke of our default in our fight against communism, anarchy and violence because of shock, hesitancy, confusion and the lack of leadership and a rallying point – the alternative to violent revolution. Now we have it – democratic revolution. And they are its apostles.<br>
There is also a default in propaganda because we refused to speak out for freedom.<br>
If we do not make a stand now, in two or three years, not 5 or ten as originally thought, there will be no need for a revolution – the communists will just take over.<br>
I felt they are now well-motivated and coordinated.<br>
I enclose the intelligence report as a sample of information we are getting, a recommendation of Ady Sison on propaganda (most of the proposals we are already implementing), and the policy speech of Prime Minister Sato.<br>
More and more Japan is participating in the regional cooperative efforts of Asia and as one of the big industrial countries, it is beginning to realize its international responsibilities. As Alichi, Japan’s foreign minister, says, “in recent years our country’s national strength has grown tremendously xxx our country’s international responsibility is becoming increasingly heavier.”<br>
Thus there is going to be increased aid, lowering of non-tariff import barriers and liberalization of capital investment.<br>
More and more, the Philippines has to watch the developments in Japan as it acquires an international and broader outlook.<br>
Right now it is shifting from private contacts with Red China to government or government-initiated ones. It is now studying a Japan-Soviet Peace Treaty. They are as Prime Minister Sato says: “adjusting defense capability to a level suitable to the national strength and situation.”<br>
However, Alchi speaks of a peace diplomacy as its basic philosophy.<br>

Monday<br>
“There is bound to be an inevitable confrontation between the communists and our democracy in the military front,” I have always said. And some intellectuals who were with Imelda and whom she brought in to see me confirm this analysis of mine (Father Horacio de la Costa, Abe Cruz and Chitang Guerrero Nakpil).<br>
The communists gamble that the Republic will be too weak by then as they will have sapped its vitality. Or that they will have become so strong that they can match their military against ours. Or they may be hoping that the China experience will be repeated where the economy became so debilitated, the inflation beyond control after Chiang Kai Shek failed to follow through his initial successes against Mao Tse Tung and allowed him to regroup his men in the north, fell to the trap of losing time by negotiations (at the insistence of the U.S, so he now claims) for unity, that Chiang’s government fell by its own dead weight.<br>
I have also said that if we do not now take measures of self-preservation, this will come about.<br>
My democratic revolution will rally the great majority of our people around our republic. But it will not stop the communists from continuing their unrelenting fight. They will not be content with anything less than the overthrow of the republic, no matter how long it takes and at whatever cost.<br>
So if there is going to be an inevitable collision, then perhaps we should induce it now while the communists are weak and unorganized.<br>
The most touching letter I have received so far is one from Father Jose A. Cruz, a Jesuit and my retreat master several times. The letter was sent today through the daughter of Ex-Speaker Cornelio Villareal, who is now a nun.<br>
It came when I was thinking the thoughts embodied in it – that contemporary writers will not appreciate what I am doing; that I face the sad prospect of present condemnation and future vindication; that I may lose all my friends and present admirers before my crusade is over; that even my family may not understand what I hope to achieve; and that my whole life is bound to be a life of controversy and tension and I shall know no peace.<br>
So I was on the verge of tears when I read it.<br>
I attach the letter.<br>
Ambassador Byroade came to see me about his trip to Washington. He says one half of his time was spent on the question I posed him in a most informal manner what the reaction would be to our decision which I told him was already made to establish trade relations with the USSR and other European socialist countries (and later on diplomatic relations).<br>
I made him understand that after the Foreign Policy Council meets, trade relations and/or diplomatic relations would be a matter of time.<br>
He had taken the proper attitude that this was an act of sovereignty that the U.S. could not intervene in.<br>
But I insisted that what I wanted to know was the true attitude of the U.S. president, Congress, businessmen and public in general, not diplomatic niceties.<br>
I had before this asked him to tell me frankly if the American government would support me if there was need to declare martial law to save the country from the communists. Nixon’s answer was “Absolutely!”<br>
I attach the two typewritten memos on the USSR.<br>
Amb. Byroade also informed me of the U.S. government decision to transfer the Caribbean typhoon moderation complex from there to the Pacific possibly in Guam. They cannot possibly do so this year as they lack equipment (only four laboratory planes when they need 14) and personnel. The principle that is being developed is rain-making by cloud seeding to lower the strength of the winds to 60 miles which is moderate compared to the 200 mile ones we have been getting in some of the 20 typhoons last year.<br>
Then we get the $20 million aid from PL 480, $15 million loan to our electrification program (jointly with Japan and as a part of the package of the Consultative group which meets in Paris, if the Japanese agree to this venue, on April 26th, this year).<br>
There are other forms of aid – close to a million for the work on typhoon damage prevention – actually concrete roofing. And some other projects.<br>
I have ordered all the conflicts on the oil concessions to be settled so that we can get the oil exploration moving. Twelve applications were sent back to the Bureau of Mines for their study and recommendation.<br>
Alex Melchor and Maj. Almonte are showing an undue interest in the release of Macahiya and the dropping of the charges against him and the men caught with him who were armed. I have asked Sec. Ponce Enrile and Gen. Yan to review the case but to decide it on the basis of the evidence.<br>
I feel that Alex is unduly influenced by the UP intellectuals for whom we all have sympathy.<br>
The strike has failed to stop traffic but there are several incidents like the shooting of a student in the head by Prof. Innocentes Campos when a human blockade stopped his car and a pillbox was thrown at it burning it. He pursued his assailants and shot at the crowd hitting a student in the head. The professor is a mathematics wizard and branded a Marcos sympathizer in the U.P.<br>

dinner for Mr. J. George<br>

Rockefeller Foundation<br>
February 2, 1971<br>
Tuesday<br>
The jeepney drivers’ strike has failed to stop traffic but the radical students at UP, Sto. Tomas and Ateneo starting woodfires: At the UP red flag at the Art and Science Bldg., Oblation statue painted red, all entrances to UP barricaded, woodfire at Venson Hall which was occupied by combined QCPD and Metrocom with 3 students arrested and one Metrocom man hurt due to pillbox explosion; at 1630 hrs. situation at Legarda-Recto becoming unruly; at 1633 students at UP burned sentry gate (entrance to Balara); while students from Ateneo stopping all vehicles passing Katipunan Road.<br>
I attach Reports Nos. 3 and 4 as well as 5 of the Advance Command Post of the Presidential Security Command.<br>
The violence will probably continue as the students desperately shore up their credibility in predicting paralization of all traffic and the media report their failure.<br>
I tried out the jeep of R &amp; D (Research and Development Br.) of the AFP under Col. Baula fueled not by gasoline but with alcohol. Engine converted by a simple circular dollar size piece of metal from gas to alcohol.<br>
I keep on pushing the prospecting of oil. Mr. Guthrie of South Eastern Sierra Madre who will drill in the Cotabato Sarangani Peninsula paid me a courtesy call.<br>
Then sought to settle the conflicts of congressmen and governors in Pangasinan, Albay, Agusan del Norte and Zamboanga del Sur.<br>
Imelda and I had lunch and a most intimate exchange of views at Suite I with Father Jose A. Cruz and Sister Felicidad Villareal.<br>
Dr. and Mrs. J. George Harrar who is President of the Rockefeller Foundation is visiting the IRRI and the Bay Medical Training Center for Rural Medical Practitioners and looking into the Population Center building for which the foundation would contribute $800,000 while we give a counterpart at the rate of one peso to the dollar. USAID gives another $800,000 and Ford another $800.000.<br>

I ordered the withdrawal of the Metrocom and the QCPD under Col. Karingal from the UP campus. It turns out that there are no Metrocom troopers in the campus and only 6 policemen of QC at the gate. There was no take-over by the military as claimed by the newspapers. The QCPD through Maj. Clemente and six men intervened only when the students having set up barricades in University Road set fire to Prof. Innocente Campos and the latter shot at some of the students. The QC Fire Department was not allowed to go in to put out the fires that had been started. There having been a crime committed and danger of more crimes being committed, the police went in.<br>
Maj. Clemente and his six policemen were pinned down by rifle fire near the two dormitories which turned out to be ladies dormitories. So they called for Metrocom troopers. Nine arrived. They cleared the dormitories. But they did not enter the basement which was full of students because they wanted to avert farther trouble. They left the<br>
campus instead.<br>
A senatorial committee (apparently the Committee on Education) composed of Sens. Tañada, Benitez and Tamano came to see me representing the whole group which had gone to the UP at 3:00 PM and found that there was no military take-over. However seven students had somehow infiltrated the UP Library which is the best library in the Philippines and threatened to burn the library if any action was taken to turn them out.<br>
The request to the QCPD to clear the University Road which is a national highway came from the inhabitants of the university community who do not ride taxis or private cars but only buses. The barricades were removed yesterday. But they were back again this morning.<br>
Mayor Villegas called up to say he and Mayors Amoranto, Claudio and Caloocan were coming to pledge cooperation in the peace and order drive. They come tomorrow at 10:00 AM.<br>
I met the Federation of Free Fishermen whose spokesman was Mayor Peña of Naic, Cavite on dynamite fishing, Vice Pres. Lopez’s Administrative Order No. 99 which allows trawlers in Manila Bay in violation of Rep. Act 3048 which allows trawling only beyond seven fathoms deep, and financing for small fishermen which I immediately<br>
attended to.<br>
I have asked Atty. Crispin Baizas to look into the causes of the student unrest. He feels it is organized and is caused by something deeper than the oil prices or the jeepney drivers. He does not trust the Jesuits.<br>

Thursday<br>
Ordered the withdrawal of all Metrocom units from the four cities of Manila, Quezon, Pasay and Caloocan after the mayors formally assumed their legal role of being primarily responsible for the maintenance of peace and order in their respective jurisdictions and after their report that their cities had returned to normalcy except for some incidents prominent among which are those of UP, Ateneo, UE and Sto. Tomas.<br>
Almost all I talk to and those who have transmitted their suggestions to me feel that S.P. Lopez, the UP President should be changed as he has become ineffective.<br>
In the MOPC Meet the Press program recorded yesterday, I had said that the incidents in the university areas did not yet warrant the imposition of martial law but that if there is massive sabotage, terrorism and breakdown of law and order, it would be time to consider it.<br>
I also reiterated that I did not want to be a strong man or dictator; that I was retiring from public life in 1973 and that Mrs. Marcos was not a candidate.<br>
The correspondent of Agence France was leading to admit that in a crisis such as we are facing, a strong man is needed and takes over the situation and the government. But I parried it with “If you are suggesting that I take over the government, the answer is NO!”<br>
One of the striking results of the UP incident is that the local police are incapable of taking over the university campuses. The military has to prepare the operations plans for such a move and implement it.<br>
I must ask Gen. Espino to include this in OPLAN MISMI.<br>
There are serious proposals to close the schools for the semester. But I do not believe that it is time to do it.<br>
Tonight Sen. Tañada called me up that the members of the faculty of the UP (Dean Cortez of Law, Miss Dayrit, head of the UP Library, Prof. Castillo of Chemistry, wife of retired Col. Castillo, Mrs. Hidalgo of the Library and Mr. Dayrit, brother of Ms. Dayrit of the Library) feel that the situation has worsened in the UP after the withdrawal of the Metrocom and the QCPD.<br>
There are more barricades and they are higher. The Arts and Science Building is completely without chairs or any furniture. They have been thrown out and burned or wood used as barricades. The barricaded Chemistry building is also in danger and it is full of equipment. This is also true of the Library.<br>
Some students are barricading themselves in the Engineering building.<br>
The Board of Regents is meeting tomorrow at 7:00 AM, then will inspect the buildings and decide as to what to do.<br>

Felixberto Olalia alleges in a Chronicle story that he was sent on an unofficial mission to Red China, by Executive Secretary Alex Melchor, to find out under what conditions Red China would accept diplomatic relations with us. Of course the alleged conditions are as onerous as severing ties with the U.S, etc.<br>
I did not know about this alleged mission of Olalia.<br>
I attach the explanation of Alex Melchor.<br>
I am sure that Ambassadors Byroade and Pichi Sun would be interested in the details of this.<br>
Today seems to be quieter than yesterday. But S.P Lopez, according to the papers, admitted yesterday that the activists were in control of the UP. – before the House Committee on Education.<br>
And observers, including Bulletin, say that a second government is in control in Manila. It is the government of the streets as they do not allow any vehicles to enter certain areas of the city.<br>
After playing golf with Maj. Gen. Espino, the Vice Chief of Staff, at 9:00 AM I met with the Sec. of National Defense, Gen. Yan, Gen. Ordoñez and Gen. Ramos on the situation.<br>
They agreed with me that ultimately the Metrocom and other AFP forces will be asked to take over in the UP and other universities; that there will be a lull of several days or a week but that the radicals will not be content with a moral victory but will go for some more objectives.<br>
So Gen. Ordoñez will now prepare a plan for the fast clean take over of the university and the arrest of the subversives if and when the Quezon City local authorities and the University administration formally requests help to root out the radicals from the campus.<br>
The same thing holds true of the other universities or areas that may be equally affected.<br>
We also expect the subversives to implement their plan for massive sabotage not only in the city but in the other parts of the country.<br>
The moment there should be massive sabotage, then must I make the decision whether to declare martial law or not. And the decision will be irreversible.<br>
3,000 baby trawler fishermen (actually using small bancas) held their demonstration in Navotas and kept away the radical elements by policing their own ranks. They asked to be permitted to continue trawling in Manila Bay which is objected to by the small fishermen (also sustenance fishermen) who claim trawl fishing destroys marine<br>
life.<br>
Sec. Bung Tanco went to meet them.<br>
We have agreed that the baby trawlers should continue fishing only on the Bulacan-Rizal side until they can be given stronger motors of 20 to 40 horsepower by better financing when they will be limited to the middle of the bay more than seven fathoms (42 ft. at 6 ft. a fathom) deep in accordance with RA 3840.<br>
I met with Father de la Costa, Chitang Guerrero Nakpil, Abe Cruz, Leo Virata and Bung Tanco on the implementation of the programs of the “Democratic Revolution.”<br>
We were all agreed that the employment program on the cottage-industry level but with control financing, management, quality control and exports should be supervised and actually run by Ting Paterno – with a joint-venture of the private sector and the government.<br>
Housing should be supervised by Ting Rojas.<br>
I have been helping Imelda put lyrics to her composition – “Philippine Welcome -Mabuhay.”<br>

Mr. and Mrs Richard Berlin are our guests at Suite I of the palace. He heads the large and prestigious Hearst Publications.<br>
We sleep at the boat (777) tonight after dinner on the way to Corregidor and Dambana Ng Kagitingan.<br>
The futile exercise that is Congress has started with Tolentino and Puyat attacking my veto of the appropriation act provision that requires the automatic release of Congressional funds including their allowances and Roy catching the Herald headline on his waging war on my executive order increasing the tariff on crude oil from 10% to 15% and Perez sarcastically commenting on our hot and cold policy on the demonstrators.<br>
I have directed the issuance of a press release on the first two items. I enclose the release.<br>
5:45 PM after the rally of<br>
the Kawani, the teachers and<br>
the enlisted men supporting the<br>
democratic revolution and the<br>
fight against the oligarchs.<br>
Atty. Lupino Lazaro, the head of the striking drivers just called me up after Bung Tanco met him, to inform me that he was calling off the strike on his own and in accordance with his conscience because he and his men “are being used as tools by evil minds” and the strike has resulted in senseless killing.<br>
He had been calling me up through Bobby Reyes and he indicated that he wanted a face-saving device so he could call off the strike. He wanted me to meet with him and the other leaders of the strikers and to appeal to them so they could graciously call off the strike. I had Bung Tanco call him to a meeting and inform him that he has to do it on his own, although if he needed to say that I had appealed to him (Lazaro) he could do so. Apparently there was no need for it.<br>
Lazaro is a beaten man. The strikers have not been able to stop the jeepneys and buses from running. And the citizenry is turning against them. Even the media has partially turned around and are in some sectors fairer to the government authorities.<br>
I doubt it if Lazaro can stop the students, though. If Lazaro calls off the strike, the students will have no ground to stand on. The UP take-over will be untenable and the students will have to peacefully hand it over to the University authorities. In a way this will be a let-down for many people who want the UP radicals to be taught a lesson, arrested and prosecuted. For that matter many people now want forceful action against the radicals.<br>
Chino Roces and Geny Lopez are up to their old tricks again. They invited the publishers and editors to a breakfast at 7:30 AM at the Andres Soriano Hall at San Miguel Bldg. allegedly to consider Senate Bill 589 of Sen. Tañada, the anti-monopoly bill which these two claim was my creation and which I asked Tañada to file (which, of course, is not true).<br>
But Chino Roces, according to Europa editor of Evening News who was sent to the breakfast by Freddie Elizalde, tried to incite Andrew Go, the publisher of the Daily Star, against me saying that I was blaming the Chinese for high prices and that I would soon burn Chinatown. And Andrew Go seemed to believe this.<br>
Anyway, these two were working for the newspapers to come out with a pooled editorial asking my resignation. Tony Araneta was for this.<br>

We docked at Pier 5 at 7:30 PM after coming from the Esso pier at Limay, Bataan at 6:00 PM. I brought the Berlins to the Dambana Ng Kagitingan which they admired. We had docked at the Esso pier at 3:30 PM and left by our cars which we had asked to come all the way from Manila at 4:00 PM. It took us about 40 minutes to get to Mt. Samat.<br>
We were supposed to go by helicopter to Mt. Samat from Corregidor where we docked at 8:00 AM but the wind was about 50 knots an hour and gusty so we went to Talaga Bay by the 777 at about 11:30 AM (it took us some time to see Corregidor as the visit included a 50-minute film “The Flame and the Sea” at the auditorium of the Pacific War Memorial, although the Berlins who are close friends of Jean MacArthur thoroughly enjoyed it and were greatly impressed).<br>
Left Talaga Bay after lunch and a short visit to the beach house with Mr. Richard Berlin whom we were calling Dick by now, while “Honey” rested.<br>
Last night they had stayed up to 3:30 AM singing and dancing. I went to sleep at 2:00 PM and woke up 8:30 AM.<br>
The strike leader, Atty. Lupino Lazaro, has again reneged on his promise. He did not call off the strike of the jeepney drivers. Typical of him.<br>
The situation in the UP (Diliman) has worsened. Ninoy Aquino who met with Sec. Ponce Enrile says the radicals have Armalites and a machine gun, have been visited by Jose Maria Sison twice, but are not helped by Dante, whose commanders, Commander Pusa etc., met him (Aquino) last week in Novaliches.<br>
And this is confirmed by a spokesman of the non-academic personnel of the UP community, Mr. Ramon J. Fernando of 27 M. Viola St., Area 3, UP Campus.<br>
I enclose his letter as well as the report of Nering Andolong, urgently requesting the intervention of the national government or giving them arms and ammunition to fight the radical students.<br>
I have ordered the acceleration of the plans by the military to take over the UP campus through the Metrocom.<br>
In Los Baños, the mayor let a protest demonstration of 600 against the students barricading the streets to and in the U.P.<br>
Tomorrow, there will be a mass demonstration where the radical students will close Jones Bridge. Mayor Villegas has given them a permit and now he asks for 200 PC men to support his police and under his control. I have ordered that they be held available but in reserve and under the operational control of the highest PC officer.<br>
The situation is developing where the people themselves will be demanding the proclamation of martial law.<br>

I have told the SND and the generals that I would not send the Metrocom to the UP using total force if the crimes allegedly committed by the rebels is only robbery or coercion. We would be laughed off the map.<br>
They agreed with me that we had to obtain search warrants and warrants of arrest for rebellion and insurrection so that we could deploy massive force in the campus.<br>
We must be able to arrest the leaders of the rebellion, control the campus after a fast and clean surprise commando raid and avoid inflicting casualties on women and innocent civilians.<br>
Gen. Ordoñez of the Metrocom will command the raid and will employ about 800 men.<br>
Confirmed intelligence is to the effect that there are strangers now guarding the barricades and sporting guns (carbines). The barricades are booby trapped. The rebels plan to use innocent civilians as hostages. So we must swiftly separate and protect the civilians before any shooting starts.<br>
And the library must initiallv be secured.<br>
I have ordered Gen. Paredes to clear Los Baños of barricades.<br>
I enclose a copy of the Feb. 8, 1971 Executive News which has an interesting piece on “Radicals Courting Martial Law?”<br>

The UP radicals lifted the barricades in the UP but military intelligence reports that the radicals reconditioned two training machine guns and emplace them atop the Engineering Bldg, and the Arts and Science Bldg.<br>
I expect that this is but a lull in the effort of the communists to create a revolutionary situation. There may be quiet now, as was seen in the demonstration of 5,000 KM and striking drivers this afteroon at Plaza Bustillos – but the plans are there to create disorder.<br>
Early this morning (3:00 AM the engineering building behind the capitol of Laoag, locos Norte was blown up by dynamite. And fire consumed the commercial center of Vigan, locos Sur.<br>
Intelligence reports are to the effect that the communists and subversives will now go into sabotage with explosives.<br>
QCPD has started to file criminal cases against the UP radicals from murder to coercion.<br>
We are encouraging our loggers to desist from cutting our forests but to turn to mining instead specially of marble.<br>
If they must continue to log, we are asking them to transfer their operations to Indonesia where they can still get good logging concessions.<br>
I have ordered Greg Licaros to do away with the technicalities of opening an LC for exports of cement (which sells for $2 a bag while it sells at P4.80 here or less than one dollar), plywood, Gl sheets and structural steel. Exports will be through the National Export Trading Corporation and since the rupiah is now freely convertible to dollars, the PNB could supervise this.<br>

I have started to conduct a survey of the sentiments of the congressmen on the constitutional convention. I had lunch with the representatives of the north, the Visayas and Mindanao.<br>
I meet with the Bicol, Visayan and Mindanao leaders Monday evening at 8:00 PM and the northern congressmen on Tuesday evening.<br>
Met Sens. Roy, Aytona, Almendras, Espina, Mamintal Tamano and Lagumbay this afternoon, then appeared on “Straight From the Shoulder” TV program of Luis Beltran.<br>
The number of telephone questions addressed to me. There was an overwhelming number of messages congratulating me for the handling of the strike and the students. They may have been reacting to my statement that the Metrocom could have gone into the UP campus and killed all the radical students but how could we have done this if we did not exhaust all the possibilities for a non-violent solution.<br>
There is a turn in public opinion. Many of the people are coming out openly supporting martial law. And many insist on a firmer policy.<br>
The surprise of this is that people now openly support the proclamation of martial law when ten days ago, before the strike, nobody would be caught saying the bad word. The change in public opinion came about because of the withdrawal of the Metrocom and the police from the UP and the tyrannical abuse, profane and gutter language of the radical students.<br>
South Vietnamese forces attacked North Vietnamese sanctuaries supported by U.S. artillery and airforce. Amb. Byroade gave me copies of the announcements. I enclose the statements.<br>
I attach a copy of the Oct. 1970 copy of the magazine “Conflict Studies” with the article “Urban Guerillas in Latin America.”<br>
The jeepney drivers’ strike was called off this afternoon by Atty. Lupino Lazaro.<br>
But today, the Armory of the UP Los Baños was blown up. And the residents of Los Baños filed a petition for injunction against the radical students who set up a barricade on the national highway.<br>
And Apollo 14 has come back from the moon and splashed down early this morning. Sheppard hit a golf ball with a No. 5 iron for 600 yards!<br>

Met with the businessmen this afternoon at the house of Charlie Palanca at 4:00 PM. We explained the housing, employment, rural electrification and tax programs. Bert Teodoro and Ting Roxas for the first, employment by employment, rural electrification by Ronnie Velasco and taxes by Sec. Cesar Virata.<br>
Enriquito Zobel opposed the investment in housing of 40% of the funds of insurance companies as he claims this would mean they would have to close up. Taxes were discussed actively and we have asked Sec. Virata, Gov. Licaros and BOI Chairman Paterno to constitute a committee to meet with businessmen on taxes; the Council of Economic Development to be the committee on housing and Ting Paterno, Ting Roxas, Dave Sycip, Jobo Fernandez and … for employment.<br>
The opinion is developing that what the Philippines needs is a benevolent dictator although such people like Armando Doronilla believe I am not the man who can be the benevolent dictator.<br>
The people are talking of this openly and discussing it in the forums of TV shows. Some day soon I must make a decision on this.<br>
Ambassador Byroade sent word that he has asked for the recall of Minister Finn for discussing or revealing the secret matters that we (Byroade and I) have talked about. I must talk to him about it. Byroade sent word through Col. Ver.<br>

Everything has quieted down but the OPEC has gotten the Western nations to agree to increase the price of crude oil and very soon the price of crude oil for the refineries here will go up and the prices of gasoline, kerosene, diesel fuel, textiles and others will go up.<br>
Then we will be expecting trouble.<br>

occurrences<br>
I attach the subjects of the merienda conference with Ray Goodman of the World Bank who felt as usual that there should be more taxes, and continued fiscal restraint.<br>
I also attach the report of Sec. Romulo on the directive I issued to him during the cabinet on the Japanese copper smelters and buyers note to our copper producers to reduce their production by 20% because the new mines in such areas like Zambia are flooding the Japanese market with copper ore (the Philippine copper producers should be given priority as they have always accommodated Japanese requests before this); I have also ordered Romulo to see how we can join the Japanese cartel in buying crude oil at better prices for our refineries.<br>
Also attached is the report of Ambassador Nolan on the sugar situation which is turning worse because of the demand for sugar quotas of the Latin American countries, Florida and Texas.<br>
I attach the petition of the Solicitor General to the Supreme Court for the remand of the electric rates case of Meralco back to the Public Service Commission because the government was not given an opportunity to present evidence against the rates which were hurriedly approved by Com. Medina before his retirement on July 2nd, 1970 even before the Auditor General had finished its audit of the books of Meralco to determine the<br>
value of investment and the rate of profit – and even before the government could present its expert witnesses (all these a denial of the right to due process of the people of the Philippines).<br>
The petition is very well written and is a complete review of my own personal views of the problem of “fair rate determination” and the rejection of the “trending or reproduction” theory of the rate base as embodied in the dissenting opinion of Justice Brandeis in the Massouri and Southeastern Bell Tel. Co. vs. Public Service Commission and ultimately adopted in the Supreme Court Case of the U.S. – Federal Power Commission vs. Hope Natural Gas.<br>
Imelda has discovered a new world. And she seems happy, deliriously so. For we are now unquestioning partners again, against all our enemies.<br>
So now I concentrate on government and can devote myself and my life to the Republic.<br>
We talked about our lives seriously this morning in bed. Casually but candidly. And we are both walking on air.<br>
This morning I devoted to the rice and corn situation. The price of corn has doubled if not trebled because it just does not exist in the market. The typhoons laid the folds to waste.<br>
And rice production was also reduced by the calamities (21 typhoons). So even in Greater Manila IR-8 and Macau if any are selling at ₱2.11 a ganta. The traders are buying from the millers at ₱24 a cavan and the millers are holding out.<br>
So I called the RCA manager, Peding Montelibano and the Sec. of Agriculture, Sec. Bung Tanco and Tony Roxas Chua of the Federation of Filipino ……<br>
With Tony were most of the traders of the Visavas and Mindanao whom we convinced to keep prices at present levels.<br>
RCA will issue a press release clearly stating that there is no rice shortage but recommending the forceful implementation of the price control commission price level of ₱1.85 a ganta of Macau and IR-8, the commandeering of hoarded, concealed and surplus stocks as well as stocks held to create an artificial shortage, of producers, millers and traders.<br>
RCA also recommends that if these measures are not enough, we accept a loan or borrow from Japan, 300,000 tons payable in 30 years with 10 years grace at 3% in rice or in cash.<br>
These will stop the speculations. But there will be a hue and cry about my having failed in the rice-sufficiency program.<br>
I attach my papers, samples of my work of the day.<br>
Saw the Israeli film on the demonstration of their Gabriel weapons system (a surface to surface missile with an optical and radar guidance system with a range from five kilometers to twenty kilometers).<br>
Three systems are recommended, each system costing $3,244,000. I have asked the Navy (FOIC Papa) to submit a recommendation.urabe<br>
But what we really need is not a missile system for the Navy but airfields for our jet fighters in Zamboanga, Davao, Cagayan de Oro, and Laoag and Legaspi in Luzon. Our fighters are now armed with missiles.<br>
I am playing golf with Ambassador Urabe tomorrow on the copper, oil and rice matters.<br>

Sunday<br>
Played golf at 7:30 AM at Pangarap with Ambassador Urabe of Japan, Gov. Greg Licaros and Bobby Benedicto. Sec. Tanco came at 10:00 AM<br>
We asked Ambassador Urabe to look quietly into the possibility of a loan of 300,000 tons of Japanese rice payable in rice or cash in 30 years with a grace period of 10 years and at 3% interest. This would be similar to the Korean loan.<br>
Apparently it is a concessional loan to developing countries. The Korean loan must be in accordance with the policy of Japan to strengthen the buffer states – buffer between Japan and Red China.<br>
Ambassador Urabe reminded us that the Phil-Japan Treaty on Trade and Navigation has not yet been ratified and this makes it difficult for him to push through any requests for Japanese aid. And he also spoke of the Japanese War Memorial. Sec. Syquia apparently brought him by helicopter to Camp Gen. Capinpin in Tanay near which a Japanese war memorial (which he hopes will be a joint war memorial for Japanese and Filipino was dead) will be built to dissipate the impression in Japan of our continuing antagonism towards them.<br>
So I have directed Sec. Romulo to organize a task force to be headed by him to work for the ratification of the treaty.<br>
The Board of Regents of the UP passed a resolution to the effect that in the maintenance of peace and order in the UP campus, the QCPD can go to the campus only upon call by the UP Internal Security Force.<br>
Mayor Amoranto told me over the telephone that he has written the Board protesting this as the UP authorities have no police authority, cannot make arrests, serve warrants etc.<br>
The Board apparently is again showing an incapacity to meet the danger of communism in the university.<br>
I attach a report of Ambassador Gonzales on the Spanish government’s action on strikes and violent demonstrations. Usually this was in the form of a decree of a state of emergency or a state of exception which is a state of emergency short of war. This involves arbitrary arrests, searches without warrant, detention for an indefinite period and banishment.<br>
Imelda gave me a song she composed – “Ang Buhay Ko’y lyong-iyo Sa Araw Na Ito.” and a medicine container in a key chain. The two girls gave us sweat shirts, mine light blue with the words in the chest “No. I Erpat” and Imelda’s dark blue black with “Da BES ERMAT” in front.<br>
I gave her some gold pearls and the girls small diamond rings (Imee a round one and a sunshine type and Irene a heart shaped one).<br>

Reflections<br>
What is my central purpose in life?<br>
I am President. I am the most powerful man in the Philippines. All that I have dreamt of I have. More accurately, I have all the material things I want in life –a wife who is loving and is a partner in the things I do, bright children who will carry my name, a life well lived –all.<br>
But I feel a discontent.<br>
Because I may not have done all that I can. Because I may have taken the easy and safer way out.</p>

I announced the reorganization of the Armed Forces with the retirement of the retirable generals (18 out of the 27 retirable generals) Lt. Cols. (13) and Cols. (20).<br>
And the reappointment of Johnny Ponce Enrile as Secretary of National Defense.<br>
There will probably be some objections to him for being a lameduck as was voiced by Louie Beltran. But I explained that there was no one else who could approximate the stature, competence and qualifications of Johnny,<br>
And I needed him for the reorganization of the Armed Forces.<br>
In the press interview this afternoon at 3:00 PM, although I went into the room at 4:00 PM, I also announced the national government had custody of a suspect in the Plaza Miranda bombing; that I had extended Gens. Ordoñez of Metrocom when I met thereafter, and Encarnacion.<br>
Played golf with Gens. Espino, Ileto and Ramos. I informed them of the plan to retire Gen. Yan and the major service commanders except Gen. Ileto becomes Vice Chief of Staff, as well as the PC Zone Commanders and the Brigade Commanders.<br>
I also met Cols. Jolly Bugarin of the NBI, Olivas of CIS and Briones of Ancar on the Plaza Miranda case. They seem to have solved it.<br>
I attach the report on the matter.</p>

So I have been immobilized the whole day and night.<br>
Could only use the telephone.<br>
Heard mass in a wheelchair. Have been moving around the room in crutches as any pressure might cause farther swelling.<br>
Gen. Yan called up to say he was not informed of the retirement of the generals. He seemed to be sulking. I reminded him that we had been talking about retirement of all generals by January 15, 1971.<br>
He was not interested in an ambassadorial position in Vietnam or Berne. Ayala made him an offer for an executive position some time ago.<br>

Have been so weakened by continuous bowel movement that my voice is falsetto. I noticed lack of coordination of my muscles even of the tongue, very lightheaded feeling and drowsiness as well as heaviness of the body.<br>
So I have been put on saturated carbon in capsules, paregoric, soda mint and on kaopectate. This has stopped the diarrhea.<br>
And I cannot eat too much.<br>
Blood examination this morning indicated low potassium (only 3 when normal is 3.5 to 5.5) due to elimination of potassium through the bowels. So I am taking liquid potassium and bananas.<br>
The doctors say that this is the cause of my symptoms of body weakness.<br>
Am much better tonight but still slightly weak. My left foot is still swollen and I cannot step on it with my full weight. So I am still using crutches. I said that I have an infected ingrown toe nail.<br>

The international situation and the forces over which we have no control but which may adversely affect our country; the rending apart of the old structure of international relations (Red China admitted into the United Nations and in the Security Council; the U.S. slowly pulling back into what could be Fortress America, India, the old leader of the neutralists now openly joining hands with Russia against China and the U.S. and Pakistan, the transition from polarization to pluralization and the flexibility of the foreign policies of nations etc. these must of necessarily affect us bevond our expectations.<br>
And so has the monetary policy of the U.S., Japan, Germany, etc. – the big team the revaluation of currencies.<br>

The Concon committee on Legislative power chairmanned by Ex-Speaker Domingo Veloso has just voted for a parliamentary form of government by a vote of 22,9,2 (the 2 being abstention). The other committee (on Executive Power) should also report out a parliamentary svstem.<br>

Friday<br>
Open House at 9:15 AM. Before that had breakfast with Sen. Barry Goldwater Sr. and his son Congressman Barry Goldwater Jr., brought by Ambassador Byroade by helicopter (our helicopter) from the airport (From 8:00-9:15 AM).<br>
Then awarding of the prizes in the PACD-Seato barrio development contest among the 33,661 barrios. First prize went to Barrio Lanao, Baugin, Ilocos Norte.<br>
Inasmuch as the prices seem to be going up, we have closed the contract with Thailand for 60% of the 300,000 tons of rice import payable in ten years with 3 years grace at 7 1/2% interest, the balance of 40% in cash (we are asking to negotiate the terms of the cash portion).<br>
Exercised again this afternoon as I have felt no pain and I could stand up the whole day on the new pair of boots made by Frankie Teodoro (Ang Tibay) for me.<br>
Am now taking colclisine four times a day with 3 aspirin tablets and 3 soda mint (to alkalize my urine).<br>
Then met Sec. Tanco on the conversation program for forestry, the financing of the rice production program (we have P208 million to be generated from the sale of still unsold RCA rice) and his resignation after May. I asked him to get a good undersecretary first.<br>
I enclose his letter and my votes on the rice purchase.<br>
He assured me he has not gambled in any casino as claimed by the rumor mongers, Women maybe but not dishonesty.<br>
We are going to divide the country into big zones so that there may be forest reserves where no settlers may go in and reforestation can be pushed hard.<br>
In the toasts for the Diplomatic Corp this morning, I spoke of man pushing the frontiers of natural science leaving behind the less progressive social and political sciences as man cannot seem to attain peace and unity.<br>
And in the Barrio Development Awards I spoke of the need to go deep into the needs of the barrios to answer the nagging question of reform and a more equitable society.<br>
I enclose the Central Bank Report.<br>

Saturday<br>
The Philippines is a small frog in the big lake croaking to the tune of the big frogs.<br>
This we have been repeatedly reminded of in the Monetary Crisis decided upon by the Big Ten, then in the decisions of the UNCTAD, the International Monetary Fund, World Bank, the military agreements etc.<br>
And yet government leaders must act as if our destiny is completely within our control. To a certain extent, though, it is within the context of the world power decisions.<br>
We must keep open our options and alternatives and use them to our advantage.<br>
This should be the burden of the State of the Nation Address.<br>
I have talked to Gov. Gregorio Licaros to prepare this study. We spent the morning before lunch on this.<br>
PAL’s holding company, Rubicon owned by Benny Toda is being foreclosed by Caltex and FNCB, the former being guarantor for the $7 million of which $3 million is delinquent. Mr. Wollahan of Caltex says Caltex does not want to take over PAL which is supposed to be a flag carrier and would rather have a private group of Pilipino capitalists take over.<br>
I have asked Bobby Benedicto and Ronnie Velasco who saw me this morning to look into this as the government does not want any stoppage of PAL flights.<br>
And PAL is farther indebted to CALTEX for about P21 million of gas and fuel.<br>
Sen. Roy came to say Sen. Pres. Gil Puyat is working to run for President in 1973 and therefore should not be allowed to become Senate President nor Party President.<br>
I am meeting the Nationalista congressmen and governors on the 11th.<br>
The Free Trade Zone must be developed as soon as possible. So I met with Joe Roxas and Pablo Roman on Bataan.<br>
Talked to Bongbong on laziness and his lack of dedication to his schoolwork which his tutors have observed. I emphasized that he may be talented but hard work makes the difference between success and failure in life. He has to leave on the 10th.<br>
Asked Mr. Emilio Yap, owner and President of the Philippine President lines and part owner of Bulletin and Liwayway Publications to agree with Hans Menzi for their transfer of control of Liwayway upon payment of the bank loan of P1.9 million. He has agreed.<br>
Justice Antonio Barredo and Sol. Gen. Felix Antonio on the need to clarify the announcement to lift the suspension of the privilege of the writ. Justice Barredo feels that I should now issue a proclamation lifting the suspension with the effectivity upon Judge Erica deciding the matter of the warrants of arrest for the detainees. But Judge Erica has said he would decide the matter in a few days.<br>
I enclose reports on this.<br>

Sunday<br>
Am at the palace while the children are giving a party at the lounge on board the 777 with the mothers supervising from the sidelines.<br>
This has been a series of parties to introduce the children to their contemporaries in Manila. I am sure that the children have enjoyed their holidays.<br>
But the report cards of Bongbong came in yesterday and I had scold him for being reported as being lazy by his tutor and not at all working hard, although talented.<br>
Imee insists on going to Harvard where there may be too much freedom. She finds Mayfield is devoted merely to passing 0 level exams and getting good grades — not good education. Or so she says.<br>
So we spent the whole afternoon after lunch in a bull session (before I left for the MBC Channel 11 inauguration at 5:00 PM) wherein Imee cried again that we do not understand her in her wish to go to Oxford. Irene cried quietly with her.<br>
I had to explain that I am concerned because my children are showing the instability that I have discovered is one of the main flaws in the character of the Marcoses including me. I had to tell them of my own experience — in athletics, in college at Pre-law and in the war. And the story of their great uncle, Antonio Marcos, who had better grades than Jose Rizal (he had the best grades ever obtained in Ateneo) and he was tops in everything he went into seriously but he had to concentrate on it. Yet when he left scholarship for politics, he was a complete flop.<br>
So all I asked was that each one learns to concentrate. “And.” I said, “I have a feeling that you are all turning into rolling stones. You have no roots.”<br>
“You, Imee, said you were discontented with Assumption College. You wanted to go to Leyte. You have become impulsive. You are never satisfied.”<br>
“But is that not necessary for progress?”, she asked in argument. The girl is logical and sharp, whatever her deficiencies.<br>

“Dear Bongbong<br>
What is happening? I gather you could not get settled doing your schoolwork after your holidays because you had such a glorious time partying here. That was not the general idea of a good time. The idea was to inspire you to more hard concentration on your studies.<br>
This is something you alone can do son. No one can help you. No matter how we, your parents, try to prepare the material things you will need to attain a comfortable life, a fruitful and successful life can only be made by you.<br>
You have all the qualities for a great future — except concentration. This seems to be your principal weakness. Self-application, dedication and assiduity. You look that up in a dictionary.”</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3645" data-line-end="3650">I came in at about 8.20 for the meditation which started at 8.15 am. Late because I had to settle several matters before I could go on retreat, one of which was the wish of the children to go back to Manila inasmuch as they had nothing to do since none of their crowd had as yet come up… Imelda was upset by the restlessness of the children.<br>
Somehow, this and other problems that have arisen in the past month have made my retreat more urgent. I have to think out the plans that I have drawn up. This includes: the report on increased subversion, the arson, the acts of terrorism in the Metropolitan area, the continued shipment of arms for the subversives, their recruitment and training and the renewed activities of the front organizations. And we have had to review the eventual use of the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and even the proclamation of martial law.<br>
So I talk to God in my retreat, asking for guidance, knowing that he sees me as I am—a man with strengths and weaknesses. I keep no secret from him as he has watched me in my nakedness.<br>
More than the reading and the thinking it is this quiet and continuous conversation with God that I attain.<br>
I have just come from the chapel where I prayed fervently that He may be with me always.</p>

My own Spiritual Exercise. I asked the Lord for a sign. And he has given it. In the meditation this morning the following thoughts were brought out.<br>
My job is too heavy. But your will not mine be done.<br>
The permissiveness of society must be balanced by authoritativeness. The two poles must be given weight and equal importance.<br>
Then in the Exercise—is it for the glory of God that there be authoritativeness? Yes for we return order where there is chaos.<br>
Fr. Ferriols spoke of recognizing the Relative of the Absolute and the Absolute in the Relative. As well as need for competence.<br>
Spiritual Exercises on the Specific Problem of Martial Law. There are certain themes that one must be sensitive to. Thus relativity. Food is good. But meat not always good. Thus, if one has had an appendectomy, meat is not good. This is the relative value of meat. Nor is cyanide to be taken at all. This is the absolute value of certain things to be taken. So I conclude that freedom is not always good. There may be periods in a country’s life when it is like meat. For the time being it must be curtailed or denied.<br>
And the permissiveness of our society has spawned the many evils that will wreck our Republic. It must now be balanced with authoritativeness and that is martial law. However, I put as a condition the occurrence of massive terrorism which would alarm the people as well as the authorities.<br>
And the discussion on authoritativeness to balance permissiveness comes incidentally in answer to some inquiry as to the problem of parents over teenaged children. The Father spoke of the problem of the Ateneo, where in the 1960s, the authoritativeness of the decade was balanced by the Ateneo with permissiveness by the Ateneo administration. And now the KMs who profess attention and ‘nagwawala’ nothing is evil or immoral. This has resulted in disorder in the mission to train and give competence in chemistry, economics, engineering, etc. which even the KMs with their avowed desire for a new society would need.<br>
So Father Cruz, our former retreat master, has instituted authoritativeness which has made him unpopular but may have saved the Ateneo.<br>
But that this should be talked about when not in the subject of the meditation. This is the sign that I have asked of God.</li>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="3707" data-line-end="3724">…Frank Starr implicates Col. Lino Aragon Angara, nephew of the late Pres. Quezon, in a plot to assassinate me on July 17, 1972.<br>
The sworn statement of Starr which is hereto attached is apparently credible and has the marks of authenticity.<br>
What is disturbing is the supposed statement of Angara “Marcos will be killed xxx And when he is dead the Vice President will become President and then our group takes over control of the Philippines.”<br>
Starr says he told me (Angara) of his contacts often with the Hon. Vice President Fernando Lopez and this report is made in sincere interest to [illegible] maneuver and shape or form to breed distrust between the President and Vice President of the RP. But in fairness to the Truth, and facts statements must be made accordingly.<br>
“I spoke to him (Angara) on at least 7 telephone calls and he said he had gone down to meet the Vice President Lopez in his home province.”<br>
This is not the first time that the Lopezes have conspired against my life. Since 1969 they have so at least three times.<br>
The old plot of Eleuterio Adevoso under Osmeña was connected to the Lopezes.<br>
And the Lopez financial and propaganda support for the NPA through Heny Lopez and the ABS-CBN included as one of the objectives my assassination. Thru Commander Melody of the NPA was assigned to this mission. Commander Melody confessed this.<br>
On the Adevoso plot, our asset within the conspiracy, Joe , revealed that the Osmeña and Lopez camps were involved.<br>
Then when on January 1970, Lopez and I parted ways, Serging Osmena suggested to Iñing Lopez my assassination and this idea was picked up and being implemented.<br>
Chino Roces had in 1979 repeatedly voiced his demand that I be liquidated as this was the only way for them (the activists) to take over.<br>
And Roces and Iñing Lopez have joined in partnership against us.<br>
They have also joined hands to blacken my character. Thus they contrived the Dovie Beams case. The funds sent to her in California have been traced as coming from the Lopez camp.<br>
They escalating demonstrations, mobs and riots, all supported by the Lopezes.<br>
And now the Lopezes have joined up with Roxas and his father-in-law, Amading Araneta.<br>
But apparently they are desperate and may be planning assassination to prevent my declaring Martial Law!<br>

The comments all seem favorable, specially after my statement that I have reestablished my friendship with the Lopezes for national unity in view of the national interest.<br>
The opposition is still in a state of shock while the Nacionalistas are jubilant.<br>
Gerry Roxas and Ninoy Aquino are meeting with Iñing Lopez on Sunday but Kokoy has been told not to be concerned as Ining will make no commitments. And that whatever obstacles to the rapprochement will be overcome.<br>
The general impression is that I have just accomplished a political coup! As Gerry Roxas is supposed to have said: “Titiklopin na yata tayo.”</p>

Imelda lost her baby at about 3:30 PM. She started having panic this morning. All internal examination showed that the uterus was larger than before pregnancy and the cervix was not open.<br>
But without her noticing it, she expelled the placenta and the body when she was heavily sedated.<br>
So we are preparing to bring her to the Makati Medical Medical Center.<br>
This has come as a (not readable) to both of us. After my speech at the (not readable) and the General Staff College I rushed back to the ship but I was so (not readable) that I slept from 6:00PM to 8:30PM when we agreed to bring Imelda to the hospital tomorrow or Saturday.<br>
As usual Chino Roces and his (not readable) (not readable) Publishing Co. PNS under Juan Mercado as mounting a propaganda campaign against me, the First Lady and now the NBI with (not readable) of planting the money in the raid on the Quintero residence, half-truths and speculations.<br>
I attach the reports of the raiding party of the NBI headed by Asst Director Arthur Figueras showing that the raid was legal, peaceful and orderly.<br>
A direct bribery case has been filed or will be filed by the NBI against Delegate and possibly Mrs. Quintero in Pasay.<br>
This morning I met with the Sec. of Justice, Solicitor General, Chief State Prosecutor Gancayco, Manila Chief of Police Gen. Tamayo, his deputy Col. Jimmy Barbero, NBI chief Col. Jolly Bugarin the chief of the NBI raiding team Asst Director Arthur Figueras and Manila Police Sgt.<br>
I directed that they take over the case of the bribery case and see to it that the (not readable) of Delegate Quintero and others who may be accused and his witnesses be protected.<br>
Cong. Mate went to State Prosecutor Gancayco to confirm his statement under oath that was the basis for the grant of the search warrant and will now be the basis for the criminal case of bribery that will be filed.<br>

Imelda is suffering from pain and from a deep sense of love and sorrow for the abortion about which I have told her. She feels inadequate and has been crying her eyes out.<br>
I have shed no tears for my unborn child but I have vowed that I shall cure this sick and ailing society that has brought about the anguish of my wife which caused the abortion. For the media has been vicious – it has condemned for a crime not charged, fasted gossip as truth and disregarded rights of fair and impartial trial.<br>
And this sick man who has committed perjury, libel and bribery has done me at least one favor. He has opened my eyes to this illness of our society that may yet destroy it. And my duty and mission is now to cure that illness.<br>
Imelda will go to the Makati Medical Center tomorrow at 7:00 AM for D and C ( Dilatation and Cure ) then rest the whole day and go to Malacañan in the evening.<br>
He have just discovered that notwithstanding his protestation that he is a poor man, he has a one-year time deposit of P100,000 the Ermita Branch of the Philippine National Bank.<br>
This was confirmed tonight at 11:00PM by Pres. Villatuya of PNB who woke up his cashier who remembered this transaction.<br>
But the cashier remembers it was a treasury warrant that was deposited of over P103,000.<br>
However, there is something strange here because he is supposed to receive only P46,000 as retirement pay which he declared in his latest income tax return and which he declared as apart.<br>
So where did the P100,000 come from?<br>
And so he is not as poor as he claims.<br>
His house in Japan was declared by him for $10,000 in 1960, $12,000 in 1963 and $20,000 in 1966 although the exchange rate was about P4 to the Dollar.<br>
The he had deposits of $37,500 – the United States while he has not declared and now it cannot be trashed in his declaration of income as well as property.<br>

And she woke up at 8:30 AM.<br>
A medical bulletin was issued at 12:00 AM. I attach a copy.<br>
We scarcely slept last night.<br>
Studied the evidence and dictated an outline for trial and cross examination to Kits Tatad.<br>
Pres. Villatuya came to show the (not readable) of the P100,000 time deposit of Quintero as of January 1972. But it was his quantity of about P96,000.<br>
Comm. Vera came to show his income tax returns showing Quintero had been cheating on his taxes, (not readable) his income and assets.<br>
Met the media in a TV interview at 8:00 PM. I admitted I was bitter because I had lost a child and this was due to our sick society which I would try to reform within the short time that I had.<br>

I have just answered a letter of Concon President Macapagal wherein he asks whether I or Imelda are running for President in 1972. I wrote him through Kits Tatad that neither Imelda or I intend to run –I because I am disqualified by the constitution from a third term and Imelda because she has no intention to do so.<br>
I asked him to do me the honor of furnishing me the original of his letter which he sent to media, so that I could answer him in more detail. And that he should exercise the leadership that is sadly lacking in the convention.<br>
Apparently Pres. Macapagal has decided to lay the blame on me for the failures of the convention.<br>
Typical traitor and coward!<br>
But from my point of view the Concon has become useless. Anything they will approve now will be rejected by the people in a plebiscite.<br>
Judge Asuncion and Director Bugarin appeared at 9:40 PM in the channel 9 TV program Background on the search warrant of the Quintero residence.<br>
Chief State Prosecutor Gancayco and Fiscal Mabutas appeared in Channel 5 in Raul Goco’s show on justice. They also explained how the requisites for the issuance of a search warrant were complied with.<br>
But the Times and the Herald as well as the chronicle have been specially vicious presenting alleged PNS reports that the people and civic organizations believe the money in the Quintero residence was “planted.”<br>
Transparent attempt to usurp judicial function and place us and the government in discredit.<br>
Chino Roces in behind all this. But the Sorianos are apparently behind him also. So I am beginning to believe that the plan is to discredit the Concon so that their interests are not prejudiced by a new and socially-oriented constitution.<br>
It would be wise to look into this. The American Lobby is suspect here. Because under the plans of the Concon, the real estate around by American Juries would have to revert to the Republic in 3 to 5 years.<br>
The Chinese Lobby is also suspect because of the problems of nationalization or filipinization.<br>
But everybody is taking advantage of it – Liberals, activists, Americans, Chinese etc. They are all fishing in troubled waters.<br>
The American Embassy is also interested in the failure of the Constitution because of the threat to abolish the American bases in the Philippines.<br>
Delegate Miguel Cuaderno was one of the principal movants and mentors of Quintero. And Cuaderno has many American clients. So has Pio Pedrosa of Prudential Bank.<br>
Cuaderno is supposed to have said that “Ang bata mo ay tila walang lakas loob gumawa na expose,” referring to Quintero. This was addressed to Delegate (not readable) Rosales of Samar.<br>

Imelda and I have been reminiscing in bed — the long tortuous road from Congress to the Presidency; the sacrifices, her tears, pain and hard work that went into our struggle for power.<br>
She put purpose into my life — the life of a spoiled bachelor congressman who was also a successful trial lawyer and a hero of the last war who tended to be too carefree and frivolous.<br>
In eleven years I jumped from congressman to president.<br>
And I have just written the children through Roy Laurence. Bongbong is our principal worry. He is too carefree and lazy.<br>
So I wrote him the fatal secret of the Marcos men — “they are brilliant but lazy.” And they tend to be so unless they buckle down to a dogged unrelenting resolve to fight off sloth or a traumatic experience turns them into bitterness that congeals into determined resolve to achieve and be victorious.<br>
I wrote him about me — how the political and financial reverses of father had made me bitter. It had come to a point where I had to get a scholarship to continue my studies. So I became a scholar — a senior scholar in law.<br>
I discovered that I had a brain and a photographic memory. And I made the best of it.<br>
I must write him about the Nalundasan case and how I vowed to top the bar after graduating Cum Laude.<br>
For the boy must get character. I have told him that since we have enemies, he will have to fight the battles I fought in the past against myself and against circumstances had been kinder to me because it had given me the motivation to work hard.<br>
I must tell him of his ancestors, his great grandfather of the revolution, the direct line of brilliant and brave men whose saving grace was the character of their women how many failed like Antonio Marcos who had exceeded the record of excellence in scholarship of Rizal – but had not done much of his life because of wine, women and<br>
song. The boy must realize his weakness – the carefree wayward ways that may have been bred in him.<br>
I am recovering from my illness. I should be able to walk around tomorrow.<br>
The Vice President took my place in the ceremonies today.<br>

Sen. Benigno Aquino, in undisguised relish predicts revolution in the Philippines. Writing in an article “Youth in Revolt” in the Far Eastern Economic Review of June 10, 1972 be gleefully quotes the (not readable) statistics of doom; the economic elite of 1.5%, the 75% poor and the 23.5% middle class; the economic profile – only 2.6% of Filipino families earn P10,000 ($1,538) or more a year, 6.8% earn 5,000 to P9,999 ($769 – $1,538) etc; Cost of education; the drop outs only 32 out of 100 finish elementary education, only 6.2 finish high school, only 4 go to college, only 0.8 get a college degree; Unemployment and underemployment: 1.1 million plus out of a workforce of 12:5 are unemployed, 5 million are underemployed; of the 1,007,133 college educated why 60.6% were employed, of the 1,041,004 with one to three years of college, only 38.3% had work, of the 1,038,306 only 78% had jobs, most being misplaced.<br>
I attached the copy of the review.<br>
Aquino, conversantly forgetting Plaza Miranda and the rice scarcity brought about by calamities with an apparent boast for his supposedly activist – supported bid for the Liberal Party presidential nomination said: “He might have added that activist youth, fragmented in ideology and strategy, was behind the tidal “no” vote given to the Marcos proxies – the candidates handpicked by President and Mrs. Marcos in the last senatorial elections”<br>
And this is the orientation of the whole article – to focus on his strength as a presidential candidate.<br>
The prediction, however, has basis for it. Although the estimate of five to ten years may be too long – or too short.<br>

<strong>Manila</strong><br>
Am suffering from pain on the right foot (the right side of the ball) and I limp when I walk. Although I have loose bowel movement and a little nausea I have had to take colchicines and butapulidine.<br>
It subsided in the afternoon. But I have been advised to keep my weight off my feet.<br>
Col. Mannor Jimenez has seen me this morning and tonight to tell me that Delegate Quintero wishes to get out of the country for good to stay in Japan. As Nick Jimenez put it in Pasacao last Saturday he makes to raise the white flag. I have asked him to say nothing but the truth to the effect that we (Imelda and I) had told him we had not authorized anyone to give money to the delegates.<br>
But apparently the activists are watching him and a certain Teresa Nieva told Mrs. Tarsila Quintero not to allow Delegate Quintero to lose heart, this afternoon. So Nick had to send his brother Ramon to Quintero to avoid surveillance, But he (Nick) will see Quintero tomorrow at 1:30 PM and see me at 4:00 PM.<br>
Ely Pamatong, an alleged youth leader wrote the Committee on Privileges of the Concon that he was aware of the “Payola” revealed by Delegate Quintero as he belonged to the group under Dr. Guino de Vega as a Technical Assistant to the office of the President. And that he was asked to deliver two envelopes full of money to Delegates Yaneza and Durant but he refused although several days later, these two delegate received the envelopes from Dr. De Vega in his office.<br>
He was the leader of Stream while does not have a following, was Technical Assistant until he was dismissed June 1st for not reporting to the office. He is a blackmailer.<br>
Apparently he has been induced to fabricate evidence by Concon Pres. Macapagal who tried to have another man to sign a similar affidavit.<br>
I may see Chino Roces on his birthday on the 29th. Executive Secretary Alex Melchor is preparing the meeting.<br>

I went to Chino Roces’ house to wish him a Happy Birthday. Arrived at 7:15 PM, left at 9:00 PM with Alex Melchor.<br>
First much bantering and fencing specially when Sen. Ilarde, Max Soliven and the other critics arrived. Chino said that I had the massive support of the media, referring to ABS-CBN, Chronicle, Herald Bulletin etc. And I said the Manila Times was the only newspaper in the Philippines that mattered. He then laughingly declared he was going to sell the Manila Times and I answered in mock – seriousness that I would organize a group to buy it.<br>
Delegate Napoleon Rama arrived to loudly announce “The President is not coming to see you!” then recoiled in shocked silence when he saw me laughing at him.<br>
But later I pulled Chino off to a corner to talk to him seriously. I asked him to help me unite the country at least for the last year and a half of my administration.<br>
He asked me to announce that even if I should be nominated I would not run.<br>
He asked me what I was willing to do to convince people that I was not interested in reelection &amp; answered, anything provided I was not humiliated.<br>
He claims that he is convinced that I am not going to run but that we had to convince the people. Specially since the people wanted a change of leadership. And that the next President would not be a Nacionalista. I kept my counsel to myself.<br>
And I thought I could trace suspicion in his voice when he asked e what I would do if the peace and order situation deteriorates. Immediately I told him I would follow the advice of the Supreme Court. Perhaps suspend the visit of habeas corpus and arrest as your people but that at the end of 1973 even if there were a revolution I would step down.<br>
He commented, “But you have to straighten things up before you step down.” And I answered “That would be the purpose but I would still step down.”<br>
We ended up with the agreement that we would continue the dialogue.<br>
I left before dinner.<br>

The parliamentary form of government won out in the Constitutional Convention against the Presidential form of government by a vote of 160 against 118 with three abstentions and about 27 absent. Some of the men identified with us like Leido, Puzon &amp; Salva voted for the presidential form of government.<br>
If this constitutional reform is ratified, the way is open for me to become Prime Minister.<br>
If it is not ratified, Imelda may have to run for President as there is no other candidate that can win against Liberals.<br>
But the parliamentary form of government will save Imelda from the muckracking of politics.<br>
The Liberals must be agitated now. And so must the Senators. For a unicameral form of legislature will follow. And they are out.<br>

Both Manila Times and The Daily Mirror claim that they said that they found the minority Muslims engaged in a religious war against the Christian Majority.<br>
But the truth is they said that the conflict was not due to religion but to many causes like land controversies, that the Muslims trust the national government but distrust some local government officials.<br>
The victory of the parliamentary form of government is being interpreted as a Marcos draft.<br>

It is my feeling that Gen. Espinio is offended that Gen. Rancudo and Diaz reported to me directly as he has not permitted an air strike.

The operations have to be completed tomorrow because the typhoon will foul up the weather and prevent the flight of helicopters and the fixed wing aircraft Tuesday.<br>
I have ordered two companies to buy up the troops in Deguyo Bay.<br>
We may have stumbled on something big there. It may be a base camp where the supplies from abroad may be dumped. That is why the NPA will not abandon it. As of this morning the NPA were still in their (not readable) positions firing down at the six teams of Maj. Resus (PMA Class ’61)<br>
Or the leaders may be there and the man landed by other submarine and/or surface craft as well as the ornaments and ammo with food supplies may be there.<br>

The reaction time of the ABG to the situation in Diguyo Bay was too long. Troops and communication were not too ready nor was air transport.

The four teams of the 4th 1B led by Lt. Santos captured 100 M-14 rifles and 30 boxes of ammunition (7.62) as of 1840 today.<br>
I suspect that the insurgents were able to carry out anywhere from 200 to 400 rifles and 20,000 rounds of ammunition assuming that the reported 200 settlers in Divinisa are NPA’s used as cargadores carrying two guns each and 200 rounds of ammo.<br>
The Dumagats and other civilian cargadores are supposed to have abandoned the NPA’s from the shock of the rocket and machine gun bombardment as well as the 75mm. shelling from the RPS Pangasinan. Some of them have been interrogated and they confirm the landings of arms, ammo and other supplies in May and June.<br>
Some of them insist the saw a submarine surface and land the serve equipment and supplies.<br>
I attach in Envelope to XXXI-C the reports on the Palanan battle.<br>
But the reaction time of the troops was too long. Otherwise we might have captured all the arms.<br>

Enemy strength estimated at 400.<br>
Our troops are pressing them from all sides. But the NPA’s seem to be tenaciously cling to their entrenched position contrary to the guerilla role of never holding ground. They have bombards from the air and the sea again.<br>
It is my feeling that they are waiting for their recruits to come in and carry out firearms and ammo. The 300 men sighted coming from the direction of Ilagan crossing the high mountains may be such cargadores they are waiting for.<br>
I have ordered mortars to be employed. The witnesses also refer to a case where the NPA’s may be conceded with their supplies I have ordered a search for the case.<br>

The media, specially the newspapers, have forfeited their right to freedom of the press. They have abused it to the point where they actually seek to falsify news.<br>
The prime example is the “karagatan” case and the fighting in Palawan.<br>
There must be some way to prevent those irresponsible advocates of not press freedom but press tyranny from weakening the state and the democracy that gives them the liberty that their friends, the communists, seek to destroy.<br>
Chino Roces, Juan Mercado, Doronilla Granada, the ABS-CBN TV-Radio group, Renato Constantino, even the Bulletin and the Herald are guilty of this abuse.<br>
Our informants tell us that they have met and agreed to belittle the communist gun – running and the NPA training camp in Diguyo.<br>

Bongbong arrived from London at five minutes to eight tonight by PAL with Lord Headfort of Ireland, the prospective husband of Nena Nable and a rich member of the House of Lords of England being one of the five Marquises (The rankings are Prince, Duke, Marquis, Count, Viscount, Earl etc ???).<br>
Sec. of National Defense J. Ponce Enrile reports after coming from Diguyo, Palanan and the first NPA camp that the NPA’s most probably succeeded in fleeing with more guns that we captured and the worse part is that in the NPA camp the boxes for rocket launchers were found but the contents had been apparently brought by the retreating NPA’s. This (not readable) more serious and massive attacks on convoys, installations and perhaps urban centers.<br>
One of the disturbing funds is large dry batteries, possibly mortars and according to Gomez who has a plane and actually saw the unloading of Karagatan, a wheeled gun (possibly a mountain gun or a mortar) was unloaded in Divinisa.<br>
So I have ordered the Ysmael road from Maddela as well as the Saur-Dingalan road to be closed so that no heavy equipment can be brought out.<br>
In the meantime the sweep of the area starts tomorrow from Dingalan.<br>
Some of the M-14 rifles were brought in by Gen. Rancudo tonight. We went to Base Operations to see them. They have only the markings M-14 with some kind of serial number but no manufacturers mark or country of origin.<br>

The SND, Chief of Staff and the Chief of all general services reviewed with me the plans for Isabela. I directed that Gen.

The road from Maddela, Quirino ((not readable) logging road) must be blocked. And while the Tf Palanan is attacking the second camp, another company under Col. Dizon (Prev.

For I support that no enemy soldiers will be in the camp at Digollirui River. They will have fled by now perhaps westward or southward to Divivisa.<br>
Palanan, probably, is also infiltrated by the NPA’s. And the new forces should be (not readable).<br>
And air reconnaissance should try to locate the nearest logging camp and farm where the NPA’s Juan Digoyo could have run to for food and shelter.<br>
I have ordered the establishment of three naval stations: San Vicente, Palanan (Bacabian Bay) and Casiguran. I ordered P500,000 to be released to the navy and 12 Marcos prefabs for all purpose buildings.<br>
Palanan airstrip must be lengthen and improved for the use of Fok kers and possibly jet fighters.<br>
This noon I directed the Sec. of Public Works and the Com. On Highways to finish the Bilac – Casiguran road and work on the Ilagan – Palanan road with the Army Engineers, connecting into the logging roads if any, as well as to improve the Appari – San Vicente road in Cagayan.<br>
5,000 (not readable) 16’s must be acquired, 1,200 from (not readable) and 3,800 from military sales.<br>
There must be a increase of the (not readable) HDF, Tabak Division and the PC which is at 40% strength and 15% armed with (not readable).<br>
The M-14’s that were captured are apparently not US made but may have been duplicated by the Chicoms or some foreign country. The word as well as the metal is being studied.<br>
Two of the BAR’s captured in Diguyo (Nos. 602721 and 22280) were lost by the PMA on 29 Dec 70. This proves that the band was apparently led by Corpis alias Ka Dencio.<br>

So we expect the rain to continue.<br>
Our helicopters flew rescue and relief missions following the national highway. But visibility is zero and the Clark Field helicopters did not fly.<br>
Even trucks could not move because some parts of the road like Carmen, Rosales and Dumalupihan are under four feet of water.<br>

Helicoptered to Central Luzon for a survey. Passed by Basa and Clark Air Bases.<br>
The water has receded from Pampanga and Bulacan but Tarlac and Pangasinan are still under water. Some people are still climbing to rooftops and tree tops. They had to be rescued by helicopters.<br>
The towns are isolated. Not only food but potable water are in great demand.<br>
The DART teams under Col. King arrival 40 minutes before me. The Tripoli and its three smaller ships (The Tripoli, a helicopter carrier may carry twenty five helicopters) are arriving tomorrow at 8:00 AM.<br>
Basa Air Base will be the operations center where all the suppliers will be ferried by plane.<br>
Tomorrow I fly by helicopter to Basa and Clark then to Lingayen and around Pangasinan.<br>
I attach reports.<br>
UUSAF Fully Gears Giant was shot by a UK – 47 at Bo. San Francisco, Bamban, Tarlac, Commissioner Juan is operating there, his engine was shot.<br>
Last might there was an unpleasant incident with Imee (we thought she was ill-mannered, but I was irritable, and (illegible)) who later apologized but her mother had punished her and the two are not talking to each other.<br>
Lt. Abao did well in the fight of San Mariano. He killed two NPA’s and captured on Max Soriano a Muslim who is now spilling the beans.<br>
I was correct in my estimate of the route of withdrawal and rate of travel of the NPA flushed out of Diguyo – they would move south then went to Pigcanauan de Ilagan River and reach San Mariano in seven days.<br>
They were flushed out by bombardment on the 10th. On the 18th they were attacking a detachment in San Mariano.<br>
And they are grouping in their camp and Grid 97 – 68 in the big map at the junction of the Pigcanauan de Ilagan River.<br>
I am glad I ordered Gov. Paranio to return to Echague 17 Saravey Hq. He was brought by Gen. Espino from Indanan on the 17th.<br>
The organization of another task force, TF Palanan under Gen. Zagala, PA Commander and its operations in the area from Palanan south to Diguyo, Digollorin and Divinisa was intended to stop and movement southward from Diguyo.<br>
Then Gen. Paranas of TF Saranay was moved with enough men back Echague so as to trap the men coming down from Sierra Madre.<br>
This is what has happened. The man who was caught (5 were caught yesterday – this has also appeared in the Herald, July 22nd) and Max Soriano caught after being wounded in the fight at San Mariano with the detachment of Lt. Abao.<br>
And he has revealed that the group at the Pigcanauan de Ilagan River is led by Ka (not readable) or Derico (Victor Corpus), numbers 60 and they are waiting for more men so that they can build up their force to 200 men and can then attack the supposedly depleted PC detachments in the lowlands of Isabela around San Mariano, Angadanan, San Guillermo, Echague and Jones.<br>
Little do they know that we have prepared Gen. Paranis with a strong force to hit them in their own encampment.<br>

Gen. Paz has a theory the guns in Diguyo, Palanan may have been given by the CIA to the NPA not to destroy me and the Republic but to make us depend on the USA. The bullets are supposed to destroy the barrels of the guns after a while. Too ridiculous and farfetched. I do not buy it. But even if they did, they would now be pulling out of such a plot so we must give them a graceful way out. I attach a report of Sec. Ponce Enrile on info given by Ninoy Aquino. I have called Congress to another special session – the third. They have not passed the budget and the tax measures among others.<br>

The stolen Sto. Niño of Tondo was found today by Imelda through Lulu Tinio, Tart Pascual.<br>
One of the robbers, (a tough known killer and one of the Parunga brothers from Macabebe, Pampanga) had offered the head, hands and feet of the Sto. Niño to Dr. Tart Pascual’s manager, Tammy , also of Cavite for P2,800. Tammy thou called Lulu Tinio who asked Imelda to go and see the specimens for sale.<br>
The bishop and father (Bishop Paulino and Father Lorenzo Egos parish priest of Tondo identified the specimens at about 7:00 PM first in the receptive hall, then in the Music Room.<br>
Shades of Lourdes and Father Pio!! – the people of Cavite talk of a crab found in that province with the image of the lost Sto. Niño in the inside of the crab shell Paeng Yabut picked this up in his radio commentary and appealed for the return of the Sto. Niño.<br>
So does Mayor Bagatsing who strongly feel with some people that the loss of the Sto. Niño of Tondo is the cause of the floods and rain.<br>

Started the repair of Manila streets. Inspected Rizal Avenue worked upon by the Armed Forces and the Com. On Highways – at 3:00 PM.<br>
At 4:00 PM, met the representative of the American president on our calamity – Mr. Frickkel and Mr. Maclure with Amb. Byroade and Tom Lubbock.<br>
Then met the private contractors, Com. on Highways, Sec. of Nat. Def., Gen. Santiago of the 51st Eng. Brigade on the large scale effort to repair the roads and to concrete 100 kilometers of Manila streets and 1,000 kilometers of national roads.<br>
Amb. Byroade told me that theor experts are almost sure that the M-14’s that were captured in Diguyo were manufactured in Taiwan. They may have been air dropped in the Chinese mainland for the underground against the Communists, the Communists may have captured them and now deployed them to the Philippine Communists.<br>
Gov. Huang, Deputy Chief of Intelligence of the Nationalist government is here, saw me at 1:00PM. With the information of Amb. Byroade I will see him again tomorrow at 12:00 AM.<br>
I told Bongbong and Irene the situation in which we are – the fact that we are now fighting for survival, that whether I retire or not our family is in danger of liquidation from either the communists or our political enemies, that if I retire I would be forced to fight for our lives because the communists are growing stronger and would be much stronger without me as President; rather than fight and defensive or losing battle later, I would rather fight now by taking over the government by a proclamation of Martial Law; but that such a proclamation would succeed if the people are with us and the people will be with us if the new government is a reform government and we are all exemplars of the new society, so they, the (not readable), must so conduct themselves that they will not antagonize the people.<br>

Gen. Ramos (Chief of PC) reports landing in Cam Sur of 60 – 70 rifles by motorized banca from Northern Luzon several weeks ago.<br>
There is a report of an attack on San Vicente port NE part of Cagayan. And the barrios on the east coast of Cagayan Province have been taken over by the NPA.<br>
The communists are tenaciously holding on to their Pacific coast camps.<br>
The ploy may be to cause a diversion in the plains west of the Sierra Madre but return to the Diguyo and Digollorin area to recover the arms they most have cached in some old camp or possibly a care.<br>
Although I think that they were able to escape from Diguyo, Digollorin and Divisina, with a substantial number of firearms.<br>
And they may have been able to infiltrate them into Manila.<br>
So we are preparing for the efforts at sabotage, tomorrow and assassination in the city planned by the communists for the month of August and September as shown by captured documents and testimony of prisoners.<br>

The Liberals led by Aquino are crying out for a share of the publicity in the Relief and Rehabilitation by pettily demanding an accounting of the relief goods distribution. I have called the petty and appealed for more maturity in the face of crisis.<br>
Today I directed the Disaster Committee headed by Sec. Ponce Enrile and Executive Secretary to render an account of the relief goods distribution.<br>
And the Senators are back to the good old political game of bickering. They have passed the Calamity bill but there are no funds for it as they have not passed the new tax laws.<br>

We are waiting for Danny and Ising Madrigal so that they can wait with Tony, Beleck, Chito and Macaria. Isings brothers and sisters are trying to amicably settle their quarrel about their property.<br>
Usually in family quarrels of the nature the peace makers get hurt but since they are our friends we are taking risk.<br>
Premier Chiang Ching Kuo sent Mr. Yang Hei-Kun Deputy Foreign Minister with a message and letter with the request for me to intervene with Japan and United States to delay or stop the normalization of relations of Japan with Red China.<br>
I attach the letter and copies of answers to him and cablegrams to Amb. Romualdez in Washington and Amb. Benedicto in Tokyo.<br>
It is to our interest that Taiwan remain a buffer between the Philippines and the mainland. But at the same time we cannot close our eyes the need for peace between Japan and Red China. War between them would embroil us.<br>
The established fact that Red China seems to be helping the local communists and may continue to do so may require a reassessment of our defense and foreign policies.<br>
We may have to keep on depending more and more on the United States. And we may have to postpone the diplomatic relations of the Philippines with Red China or even Russia.<br>
Thus the continuance of the Military Bases Agreement.<br>
The reports of submarine landing personnel and arms in the Divinisa, Palanan area must make me cautious about cutting our ties with the United States.<br>
For the next two decades we will not be able to defend ourselves against Red China &amp; Japan.<br>
And anyway for a self-reliant national defense we used military assistance from the United States whether on the basis of foreign aid or access.<br>
Manila Times, Chronicle, Bulletin and The Philippine Herald among other media are still trying to make the Plaza Miranda grenade incident that was the principal cause for the victory (from sheer pity felt by the electorate for the Liberals senatorial candidates) of the situation last year, a rallying cause against the administration.<br>
It is obvious that the liberals are making use of the newspapers and the radiants or radian it is a question as to who is using who<br>
But only 3,000 attended the rally at Plaza Miranda and there have been no incidents.<br>

I have directed the Se. of Justice with the Solicitor General to analize the Supreme Court decision on Parity and ownership of public and private agricultural land. To stop speculations and possible misunderstanding I wrote the Secretary the guidelines that his recommendations be submitted to the cabinet meeting set for ward Thursday, the 24th, be based on:</p>
<ol>

And to reassured both administrative and legislative action.<br>
I attach copy of the handwritten order.<br>
The business community is in a state of Ferment and clearly pulling out. I do not believe it will. Now that the rules of the game are clear, there will be less uncertainty.<br>
It is obvious, The Manila Times is trying to build up Sen. Jose Diokno as a presidential candidate. The Times Today estimated the 3,000 Plaza Miranda crowd on the Aug. 21st Plaza Miranda rally as 15,000, as usual bloating the figures for a purpose.<br>
And the cry was against the increasing militarization order the Marcos administration.<br>
Not much impact. The citizenry despite being asked their rally but did not give it much more attention.<br>

Just finished all the paper work that has piled up with the urgency of the calamity and with the third congressional special session about to and on the 1st of September. We have to prepare some compromise bills in a hurry –- on public works to include reconstruction and the authority to borrow, tariff, tax on cigarettes, removal of exemptions and subsidies, amendment of the special highway fund law etc.<br>
This morning I inspected the cemetery at Mendiola, covered Rizal, J. Abad Santos and M. H. de Pilar – after golf where I scored one under par.<br>
At 12:30 AM I met the Director Bugarin of the NBI, Cong. Cojuangco and Adrian Cristobal.<br>
Col. Bugarin reported the results of the investigations on CAA illegal contracts (The Contact Construction for Teletype machines:Overpriced and second hand), no unit losses on the Cueto killing by Yabut’s police, the dollars confiscated in the airport should be forfeited, in drugs there is raw intelligence connecting Cong. Baduya, Teves and to a heroin refining center in this area I directed continued surveillance and investigation.<br>

Cong. Cojuangco came to inform me of his success in getting a contract for 40,000 tons of rice from Red China, bartered for cement. I am encouraging barter for rice from Red China so that we do not spend any of our much needed dollars.<br>
Adrian Cristobal came to show me a paper on the ideology of the Free Farmers Federation and their ideologies, the Lakasdiwa headed by former seminarian Ed Garcia (they call father).<br>
Looks sophomoric. But attacks for both Maoism and Capitalism. And can be used as a basis for study for an acceptable ideology and program of government.<br>

This afternoon I met with the congressional leaders, Sen. Pres. Puyat, Senate Floor Leader Tolentino, Sen. Teves, Acting Chairman of the Ways and Means Committee Speaker Villareal and House Floor Leader Marcelino Veloso. The Senate wants to adjourn after the Tariff and Customs, Code and the tax on cigarettes is approved – to meet in the regular session next January. The House wants the Public Works bill, the amendment of RA 917 at least approved also before adjournment. We are trying to get them to continue working for at least<br>

a week more. Specially since there is no money for the calamity appropriations and no authority, for borrowing abroad. The Foreign Borrowing Act, RA 6142 limits me to borrowing for projects provided for by law (specially the public works act) and no existing public works act authorizes the reconstruction projects nor some of the on-going projects – ergo we cannot borrow for them.<br>
Thus, there would be no money or cash for the Reconstruction or Rehabilitation Program.<br>
And Congress which is supposed to be controlled by our party would be open to the changes of indolence and impotence to meet the crisis occasioned by the floods.<br>
The rest of the world is helping to rehabilitate us. But Congress wants to adjourn and go junketing abroad – the UN, the APU, and conferences that are convenient excuses for a visit to the flesh pots of America and Europe.</p>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4641" data-line-end="4648">I just talked to Kokoy Romualdez at Washington on the cablegram report of Ambassador Eduardo Romualdez on his talks to Marshall Green, the State Department man of the Far East on the reported Japanese plan to recognize Red China, in which conversation Marshall Green ‘bluntly told us that the Philippine government has overestimated the aid extended by the Chinese (Red) government and the Chinese community in the Philippines to the local communists.<br>
The U.S. State Department has a constant record of error in the assessment of Asia’s situations and judging Red Chinese intentions. It is preposterous, therefore, for them to lecture to us on their estimate of the threat we face from the local communists.<br>
And apparently, they are at it again in the Philippines.<br>
Perhaps, the U.S. Embassy here is most to blame. For I think the Ambassador and his staff, the CIA man, [not readable], have finished as of last year a report on the Isabela situation concluding that the NPA operates out of the pocket of Sison and Corpus? And does not pose a serious threat numbering less than 100.<br>

How stupid can they get?<br>
And after we, in the government, had [not readable] the interlurking of the front organizations in the cities like Manila (like KM) with the NPA, the CIA man, [not readable],offered to spend good money on the operations of whether there was any connections at all between the front organizations and the NPA.<br>
If the NPA has no funds except those from the pockets of their leaders, where did they get the P5 million that was used, according to the captured NPA, in the purchase of the 55 Karayalan and the about 2,000 M-14 rifles, ammo, rockets, communications equipment, allotting and food.<br>
And why is there an increase in their number, so much so that in west engagements in Isabela, our bays were outnumbered, contrary to the basic principles of guerilla warfare.<br>
The NPA is spreading to the Bicol, Samar, Leyte, Panay Island, Negros, Mindanao and over Sulu.<br>
And the KM’s are proliferating in greater strides.<br>
What about the Supreme Court decision. Are the Americans saying that the justices are incompetent? Like all of us, supposedly?<br>

Then the ambush in Marikini of a Metrocom car which resulted in the capture of an M-14 with serial number beginning with 620 like the M-14’s captured in Digoyo, Palawan.<br>
So I have asked Gov. Romualdez to ask our friends, like Gen. Blackburn and Poling Valeriano to put things aright in the lower levels.<br>
And to send word to the cabinet level and National Security Council level that I feel that we are being misused.<br>
Anyway I was so exercised by the reported ex cathedra statement of Marshall Green that I asked for the clarification of the intention and purpose as well as the surrounding circumstances of the statement.<br>
But that is the U.S.<br>
This reminds me of the assessment of the 1970 situation in US News and World Report (Feb. 23, 1970, p. 54 – Worldgram) – “Add this to Asia’s Troubles: Filipinos are on the break of a peaceful – or a bloody revolution. Change must come quickly. Everyone<br>

agrees on that.<br>
Filipinos have lost confidence in their political leaders. The treasury is virtually empty, exports are lethargic, the peso is weak and corruption is rampant. The gulf between the very rich and the very poor is widening.<br>
Is the U.S. to blame for this crisis? Not at all. Yet it could end up in the middle Filipinos who respect Americans are asking what the U.S. will do? Stand behind the legal Government, or with those who demand reform?”<br>
This is one of the most preposterous, false and misleading statements I have read.<br>
It is a restatement of the position of the political opposition – of the irresponsible press – of Chino Roces who went to the extent of demanding my resignation as President at the height of violent demonstrations which started in Jan. 26, 1970.<br>
Incidentally our exports increased by 21% in that year 1970!<br>

Friday<br>
Awarded the Order of Sikatuna, Rank of Datu to the Indonesian Minister of State for Defense and Security Vice/Asst. Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of Indonesia — Gen. Maraden Panggabean. He looks like a capable soldier and helped us well as cooperated with him in various battles specially against the Dutch and the communists.<br>
He says Indonesia is peaceful but for the 1,000 Chinese communist subversives in Sarawak. He laughingly referred to the 10,000 communist prisoners in Pulo Buro (Island of Buro –as in Tagalo Pulo means Island — and itik <s>is</s> also means duck). A critical article was written a few months ago of the treatment of the 10,000 political prisoners that are supposed to include some of Indonesia’s best thinkers, intellectuals, writers and philosophers who must eke out a living by farming the island in what was described as a marginal back breaking type of activity.<br>
Then conferred with Sen. Daniel Inouye after his field trips inspecting the calamity areas.<br>
He confided to me that he did not merely come to see the damage caused by the calamity but also to see the general situation.<br>
And he will carry the message that the U.S. should pay more attention to the Philippines.<br>
He also remarked that Amb. Byroade has the same thinking as I have on the communist threat; that we should seek the help of friends like Speaker Carl Albert and Mike Mansfield although the latter is against the extension of military aid.<br>
When he asked me what kind of hardware we need for our armed forces, I explained to him that we are actually buying our small arms from the U.S.; that we do not intend to mount a defense against aggression but against subversion and we would give priority to helicopters, mortars and recoil less rifles, and that we are not asking for additional military funds but to participate in the surplus from Vietnam.<br>
He answered that he would do everything to have us classified in the same priority as Thailand.<br>
He asked me what is going to happen. He explained that he has been told there are four options: 1. Extension of my term 2. a parliamentary form of government 3. I run for reelection 4. Martial law.<br>
I immediately countered that I do not need martial law to win an election and that in the present situation anybody I supported would come out; that I would not agree to allowing the First Lady to run since it would be unfair to her. “We are too old in this game to need martial law to get votes,” and he smiled with understanding.<br>
“However,” I explained, “do not misunderstand me. If the communists sow terror in Manila, if they bomb and burn, kill and kidnap, if they use the Vietcong tactics, then I will not hesitate to proclaim martial law.”<br>
“What I would prefer would be an extension. But I would accept it only if the political opposition agrees to it. If they do not I will not agree to it.”<br>
“I would then try to be a Prime Minister.<br>
“But I would first wipe out the communists before the next President or Prime Minister [takes] over so he has a chance. I used [  ] to build up my replacement. None of those now are fit to lead the country. Aquino, Diokno are demagogues and are communist. They would immediately set up a communist regime. Roxas is a weakling. He would not risk his life to protect out freedoms. Puyat is an oligarch. He has too many investments to protect.”<br>
“What we need is somebody who is trusted by the Armed Forces, is a liberal thinker, will fight communism and will risk not only his life but everything in this fight.”<br>
“For I cannot believe that Red China can be trusted. She will try to show  now she is house-broken but she will help the revolutionaries and communists in the Asian countries. She is going to try and establish an Asian hegemony or a sphere of influence.”<br>
When we talked of what I emphasized was urgently needed –reforms, and explained that I would like to have the private commercial corporations give the fringe benefits doled out by welfare states after taxing the big corporations, he called attention to the fact that Japan does this. The corporation is a big family. All the officers and employees are given the benefits that would go to recipients in a welfare state and when the workers go on strike, they were a red arm band but keep on working so that they do not prejudice themselves.<br>
Sen. Inouye will be a great help to the Philippines.<br>
Imelda is busy decorating the Big Antique.<br>
She tells me, San Juan, without the houses is eerie at night –with the big trees. Something out of Wuthering Heights! She was there last night.<br>

I announced the decision to sustain the BOI to have the five remaining bidders: Ford, Gen. Motors, Chrysler, Mitsubishi, Volkswagen and Toyota –there being no agreement or evidence to alter the BOI decision. But any of them which does not comply with its proposal at any given year will be immediately disqualified that year.<br>
AP man Gil Santos will carry the story of the Indonesian government furnishing us information on Jose Maria Sison and the PKI (the Partai Komunis Indonesia); how Sison received direction, funds and support from Indonesia. Even the constitution of the New Communist Party of the Philippines was drafted or approved in Indonesia. Barki was the contact.<br>
We are working on the pine tree forest in Davao and Cotabato for pulp. It may be 300,00 hectares instead of 100,000.<br>
And the long-fibered pulp may be good for rayon, not just newsprint.<br>
And looking for marble in Tanay, Bulao, Palawan and Mati. Even Marking Agustin my tocayong balictad offered some marble in Tanay.<br>

Imee left by PAL for San Francisco and Monterrey’s Sta. Catalina School run by the Benedictine nuns. She will be coming back for the Christmas holidays.<br>
She was in such a hurry that we did not give her any cash nor get her telephone number. But she should be able to manage.<br>
Played golf with Gen. Maraden Panggabean, Indonesian Minister of State for Defense and Security Forces –at 6:30 AM– teeing off across the Pasig on Tee No. 1. He lost the first ball in the water and crossed on the second.<br>
Amb. Monet Nolan brought me the sugar act of the U.S. which provides that in case of expropriation of American property without compensation, the sugar quota can be suspended or a $20 per ton levy imposed by the U.S. President.<br>
I have called the sugar industry leaders to a conference on Wednesday.<br>
Directed that the MIA men (customs, Gen. Man. Luis Tabuena and CAA Adm. Singson) stop the practice of allowing non-passengers enter the area of the departing or arriving passengers. This because of a stowaway in one of the foreign planes and the complaint of the international pilos that we are not taking precaution against possible hijacking.<br>
The propagandists of the communists –among them Sen. Ramon Mitra keep insisting that the terrorism and the bombings by the leftists and subversives are perpetrated by the AFP to condition the people to martial law.<br>
I told Gen. Menzi today that the Bulletin News Editor, Antonio Zumel, is one of the three propagandists of the Communists. I told him that the two others are with Chronicle and Taliba (without mentioning Granada and Fadol of those newspapers). He admitted that Zumel was a Red. I must resign my aide, LtCol. Zumel his brother.<br>

The crew members of the Red Chinese ship “Anting” arrogantly refused to come and meet with me after I had met with the Ambassador Lin Chek and his delegation of Nationalist China to receive 3 1/2 tons of vegetable seeds.<br>
This is indicative of the Red Chinese kind of manners and intentions. They send in ₱2 1/2 million of relief goods through the Red Cross and then kick you in the face.<br>
Before that I had refused to see Antonio Araneta, [     ] Planas, and the Chamber of Commerce accompanying them as they would use this for propaganda politics. And we end up with propaganda. Charming manners! And more [    ] politics!<br>
This is the final proof of the need to do away with the Maoist Communists in the country.<br>
Had lunch with the World Bank Team Hassan, Dickerson and Van Heflen. We hope to get a simple package for roads of $55-100 million in the form of long term loans.<br>
Directed the disposal of surplus Virginia tobacco. And talked to Tony and Ruby Martel on pulp, housing, steel and the economic atmosphere.<br>

The Concon voted down the ban Marcos resolution by 155 votes against 131. Some of those who pose as friends voted against us. Carlos Ledesma, Angara (Johnny Ponce Enrile’s partner). Tiling Yulo was absent. Ditas Teodoro and Elizabeth Chiongbian voted by teller but these were not recognized.<br>
Macapagal delivered a bitter vicious attack against us. So did Rama. But Sotero Laurel and Cuaderno spoke in our favor.<br>
14 were killed in the Israeli kidnapping by Arabs as the German police ambushed the Arabs and their hostages on the way to the airport.<br>
I have ordered our entire delegation to be pulled out and denounced the senseless brutality.<br>
Last night 8:30 PM Joes Store in Carredo was blown up, by a time bomb of dynamite, killing one and wounding twenty two. I attach the report.<br>
We lost one helicopter in Palanan, Isabela yesterday morning at 8:30 AM. It crashed into the sea because of engine failure. A Navy boat saved all the occupants. Only one (a co-pilot) was slightly injured.<br>
Yesterday I told Rey Johnson of Caltex that the American businessmen are worried about their properties and profits while we, the Filipinos are worried about national survival. Our lives are at stake.<br>
The message I asked them to convey to their American bosses in business and in government that we would like them to help us fight the communists. Otherwise we cannot help them.<br>
This is the line we must follow.<br>

The police will in the event of a contingency attend to what may be merely a local peace and order problem, but the moment there is street fighting the police leave the streets and allow the Metrocom and Gen. Ver’s forces to engage the enemy.<br>
This will prevent mistake encounters between our own men and forces as happened in Malaysia and even now in Ireland.<br>

Sen. Aquino is, of course, playing a double game. He was in danger from the Maoists, as reported by him to Sec. Juan Ponce Enrile.<br>
So I believe he negotiated in a meeting with Jose Maria Sison and is protected from that side.<br>
But now he is convinced he is also in danger, from the government. So he goes through the motions of giving information to the Secretary of National Defense to get protection from government.<br>

Birthday celebrations limited to mass and a meeting with the governors and mayors which has turned out to be tedious. I have barely finished with 38 and will have to meet the rest after the Security Council tomorrow.<br>
But it has been an eventful day. The Meralco was bombed in two places last night.<br>
Today the Manila Police battled a jeepload of NPAs, capturing six killing one armed with a carbine five hours after he escaped although another of the escapees armed with a Thompson submachine gun is still being hunted and a Sgt. de Guzman of the Manila Police was killed.<br>
The kidnappers of Tom Aguirre (Banco Filipino) and his son Antonio released them after they paid ₱1.2 million. The kidnappers were well disciplined, had a basement full of communications and had apparently been succesfully kidnapping Chinese for ransom — Tony Roxas Chua’s wife for ₱1 million, La Suerte owners in the same amount, Chen Ba Yek and others.<br>
The NPA’s may have raised their funds in this manner.<br>
So there is hysteria in Manila from a bomb and kidnapping scare.<br>

<strong>Malacañan Palace</strong><br>
<strong>Manila</strong><br>
Bongbong’s Birthday. Right now they have converted Suite I into a nightclub complete with strobe lights and blow-up pictures of Bongbong.<br>
And there are more girls than boys. In fact there are only a handful of boys and about five times of girls.<br>
At the rate the tension and hysteria in Manila continues, I may have to declare martial law soon. Many people are not leaving their houses.<br>
Threats to bomb and blackmail is rampant. KBS and the Daily Express were told to raise P200,000 otherwise there would be a bomb for them. This was conveyed by a certain Policarpio, a KBS labor leader. He probably cooked it up.<br>
So I met with Johnny Ponce Enrile, Gen. Tom Diaz, Col. Montoya, Col. Romy Gatan, and Danding Cojuangco this evening at Pangarap and we agreed to set the 21st of this month as the deadline.<br>
In the meantime Sen. Aquino in a privilege speech, today, claims we have an OPLAN Sagitarrius, which allegedly includes placing Greater Manila under PC Control preparatory to proclaiming martial law.<br>

This is nothing but the contingency plan for the coordination of the local police forces and the Armed Forces in case of insurgency.<br>
It is ridiculous to ascribe it to the plan of martial law since it referts to calling out the troops to quell a disorder.<br>
But of course the media will give it all kind of meaning.<br>
But, again, perhaps it is best that the political opposition start a debate that will get the people used to the idea of emergency powers.</p>

<strong>Manila</strong><br>
After golf, at 9:00 at my room at Pangarap while taking breakfast, I told the SND, C of S, Major Service Commanders (Gen. Ramos, PC, Gen. Zagala, PA, Romando, PAF and Commodore Ruiz, PN) Gen. Ver and Gen. Paranis that I intend to declare martial law to liquidate the communist apparatus, reform our government and society, then have the Concon ratify our acts and the people can confirm it by plebiscite and return to constitutional processes; but that I needed at least one year and two months; that this would be a legitimate exercise of my emergency powers under the constitution as clarified by the Habeas Corpus case by the Supreme Court last January; that we need to cure the ills of our society by radical means (I mentioned corruption, tax evasion, criminality, smuggling, lack of discipline, unequal opportunities) so we must keep our moves clean and submerge self-interest.<br>
I asked for any objection to the plan and there was none except for the observation of Gen. Ramos that the closing of the media should be done by a civilian minister supported by the military, and Gen. Gen. Rancudo who wanted missions definitely assigned to each branch of the service.<br>

Amb. Byroade came to see me after the presentation of credentials by the new Malaysian ambassador.<br>
He left me the Memorandum of Conversation of Marshall Green, Asst Sec of State, East Asian and Pacific Affairs and our Amb. Eduardo Romualdez.<br>
I attach copies of the same.<br>
Then he explained that he kept White House informed weekly of developments here — and that the communist threat was increasing.<br>
We talked of the parity decision, the Lustovaco decision as well as the other developments against the Americans. He claimed that the US senators had indicated a desire to dismantle the sugar quota.<br>
I told him he might start something that would have no end; and that anyway the sugar industry was ready to lose the quota for the national welfare and sell our sugar in the world market.<br>
I suggested that while we in the Philippines were talking of survival, the Americans were talking of property and profits. And we were not thinking in the same plane.<br>
He said he had heard from other persons<br>

Met the Japanese Parliamentary delegation decorated with the Datu of the Order of Kalantiao. The Grand Chancellor of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, Quintin Jeremy Goyn.<br>

<strong>Manila</strong><br>
As I expected the Liberals and the Manila Times have started to make much of Oplan Saggitarius.<br>
So I have openly appealed to the Liberals not to connive with the communists, revealing that Jose Mari Sison and other communists met with Liberals for a common front and consolidation of forces on propaganda, logistics, armed support and prevent the use of emergency powers — giving details.<br>
I am sure this will start another raging controversy.<br>
The reason there is a clamor for martial law is the open threat of the communists to punish the officers including me even after the termination of their office ; the fact that if nothing is done the Communists will take over and the half measures like the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus will not do: and the society has to be reformed.</p>

<strong>Manila</strong></p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5045" data-line-end="5054">We escaped the loneliness of the palace for this old Antillan house now known as Ang Maharlika, the State Guest House several blocks from the palace. It has been restored beautifully by Imelda and is a symbol of Philippine culture in the last century. Almost all our antique valuables have been transferred here.<br>
The departure of our children has made the palace a ghostly unbearable place.<br>
I took a long nap (4:30-7:30 pm) in the room of Bongbong which has the worst bed [illegible] and the lumpiest mattress.<br>
And after an early simple dinner of sardines and pancit, I was able to browse in the library where to my delight I discovered the books I have been wanting to read for some time including Fitzimmons, The Kennedy Doctrine, Sorensen’s The Kennedy Legacy, The Dirty Wars edited by Donald Johnson (some of the principles and lessons are outmoded), Days of Fire by Samuel Katz (The Secret History of the Irguny Zrai Sanmi and The Making of Israel, Chou-en-lai by Kai-Yu, Room 39 by Donald Macfaddan (The room of the British Intelligence in WWII), the History of the World in the 20th Century by Watt, Spencer and Brown.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5055" data-line-end="5069">I have invited the Liberal Party leaders (at least ten of their hierarchy) to come to the palace on Sept. 19th to be informed of what we have on the negotiations and agreements between the Maoists and the Liberals.<br>
The Liberal head, Sen. G. Roxas, issued a demand for us to point out the Liberal negotiating with the Communists, knowing full well that I refer to Sen. Aquino, his opponent for leadership in the party and wanting to disqualify Aquino by his own action.<br>
But the Liberals should not get out that easily.<br>
For some of the other leaders have been dealing with the Communists –Mitra, Yap, Felipe, Dy, Pendatun, Lucman, etc.<br>
Antonio Zumel, news editor of the Bulletin had an explanation of his Trade Asia activities in today’s papers. He adopts an aggressive stance of hurt innocence!<br>
I received the report on the 7,400 case of dynamite apprehended in the del Pan bridge by the OOSAC<br>

The Air Manila plane was apparently bombed at 4:40 am yesterday by a grenade in a valise with incendiary bombs over Romblon, prepared to ditch because of the right engine being out of commission from the grenade blast but was able to limp up to Roxas City where it landed at about 5:00 am in the dark with nothing but its landing lights to guide it. Capt. Samonte, the captain of the plane did a good job and was lucky.<br>
I have checked on the plans of the delegations I am sending to the IMF, the UN and other international conferences.</p>

The Concon and the sala of Judge Lustre of Quezon City trying the subversives were bombed by unidentified person this afternoon at 3:40 PM. It caused extensive damage and injured about thirty people.<br>
Two of the subversives were almost able to escape.<br>
This is apparently the answer of the subversives to the raids on their headquarters in Manila, Quezon and Pasay last Sunday morning at 4:30 where about 48 were arrested including Cabardo, a former PMA cadet who is tagged as the Visayan NPA head.<br>
Ex Sec. Peding Montelibano, after bringing the problems of the PNB and the sugar industry, pledged that he and his family (one governor and one congressman) were behind me and Imelda even if I proclaimed martial law.<br>

Paz, 1st PC Zone Commander, Gen. Diaz and Metrocom commander, Co. Montoya, with Gen. Ver in attendance.<br>
They all agreed the earlier we do it the better because the media is waging a propaganda campaign that distorts and twists the facts and they may succeed in weakening our support among the people if it is allowed to continue.<br>
So after the bombing of the Concon, we agreed on the 21st without any postponement.<br>
We finalized the target personalities, the assignments, and the procedures.<br>
Our communications network will center in Malacañan as before.</p>

Sen. Roxas had written that they were not attending the meeting.<br>
I attach copy of the letter.<br>
So since I invited Sen. Pres. Puyat, Speaker Villareal, (Sen. Roy did not come) Cong. Yñiguez came I explained to the media which was covering us that when I invited the leaders of the Liberal Party I had wanted a private conference where we could, as Filipinos and for the welfare of our people, agree that neither party (Nacionalista or Liberal) would “link-up” with the Communist Party<br>

The two Americans paid to assassinate me were supposed to do the job this morning but when they tried out the guns (even the .22 caliber) they were too loud.  This was explained by our penetration man, Talastas.<br>
They have prepared a Comby wagon, put a hole in the back and have tried to park it between the press and the Maharlika or the boathouse and they can swipe at me at the Pangarap boat landing on the golf course.<br>
I declassified two documents which contain reports of Sen. Aquino to Sec. Ponce Enrile and Gen. Ramos July 27th and 29th, this year which show his propensity as a blubber mouth.<br>
I attach copies of the documents in Envelope No. XXXV-A.  The original reports were in my diary.  Then I wrote Sen A. Roxas to inform him that what I wanted to do in the conference was<br>

not to blame anyone but to break up a “link-up” of the Liberal Party to the Communist Party if any.  I attach this letter in XXXV-A.<br>
I sent a  copy of the letter to all senators because of the expected privelege speech of Aquino copy of which I attach in XXXV-A.<br>
Sen. Perez put my letter on the record.<br>
Sec. Ponce Enrile dared Aquino who had denied his report, to a confrontation which the latter refused.<br>
Sen. Maceda filed a motion to investigate Aquino but he withdrew it when Roxas objected.<br>

This afternoon General Staff with the SND and the Chiefs of the major services came to see us to submit the Assessment of Public Order wherein they recommend the use of  “other forms of countering subversion/insurgency should be considered.” This means they recommend the use of Emergency Powers including Martial Law, formally.  Envelope No. XXXV-B.<br>
Then we gave an interview where we kept silent on Emergency Powers but spoke of listing Arrival (?) syndicates in the Order of Battle of the communist armed elements, the Self-Reliant Defense Posture as it relates to internal threats, expenditures, additional armaments and personnel etc.<br>
I was surprised to hear Sec. Melchor say he was now in favor of Martial Law although he was against it a year and a half ago.  And all Sec. Abad Santos said was, Let us not talk about it publicly.<br>
I asked Sec. Melchor to submit a study and recommendation in writing and to prepare to use his American contacts to see the U.S. does not oppose us.<br>

Delayed by the hurried visit of Joe Aspiras and Meling Barbero who came from the Northern bloc of congressmen and senators who want to know if there is going to be Martial Law  in 48 hours as predicted by Ninoy Aquino.<br>
Of course Imelda and I denied it.<br>
But Johnny Ponce Enrile, Gen. Paz, Gen Nanadiego, Kits Tatad and I with Piciong Tagmani doing the typing finished all the papers, (the proclamation and the orders) today at 8.00PM.<br>
Amb. Byroade came to see me at 11.15 AM and was apparently interested to know whether there would be Martial Law.  He seemed to favor it when I explained it is intended to primarily reform our society and eliminate the communist threat.  But he suggested a proclamation before the American elections may be used by MacGovern, the Democratic Presidetial candidate as proof of the failure of the foreign policy of the present president.<br>
I told him I did not want it said that he was intervening in internal matters of the Philippine government.  And that no decision has been arrived at but that I was under pressure and there<br>

seemed to be no other solution.  He agreed that there seemed to be no other solution but he told Gen. Romualdez later this day when Kokoy went to see him that his impression was that Martial Law would be proclaimed after the elections.  How he came to arrive at this conclusion I can only guess.  But this man cannot make logical deductions.  I must be wary.<br>
He wanted Kokoy to go ahead and work in California for Nixon.  There are 200,000 Filipino votes and California is crucial.<br>

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5203" data-line-end="5204">On the Sisteneco (?) case, that Americans holding equity in corporations could become directors, executive managers only if the area of investment is highly technical and no qualified Filipinos are available.</li>

Sec. Juan Ponce Enrile was ambushed near Wack-Wack at about 8:00 pm tonight. It was a good thing he was riding in his security car as a protective measure. His first car which he usually uses was the one riddled by bullets from a car parked in ambush.<br>
He is now at his DND office.  I have advised him to stay there.<br>
And I have doubled the security of Imelda in the Nayon Pilipino where she is giving dinner to the UPI and AP as well as other wire services.<br>
This makes the martial law proclamation a necessity.<br>
Imelda arrived at 11:35 PM in my Electra bullet proof car to be told that Johnny had been ambushed, it is all over the radio.<br>

I conferred with Speaker Villareal, Roces, Yñiguez and Barbero who are going to Moscow and they are ready to leave on Sunday.  So they are decided to finish the session same.<br>
Senate President Gil Puyat insists that the next special session be early January.<br>
And they will not be able to pass the urgent bills like the rehabilitation bill.</p>

Things have moved according to plan although out of the total 200 target personalities in the plan only 52 have been arrested, including the three senators, Aquino, Diokno and Mitra and Chino Roces and Teddy Locsin.<br>
At 7:15 PM I finally appeared on a nationwide TV and Radio broadcast to announce the proclamation of martial law, the general orders and instructions.<br>
I place them in Envelope XXXV-C<br>
I was supposed to broadcast at 12:00AM but technical difficulties prevented it.  We had closed all TV stations.  We had to clear KBS which broadcast it live.  VOP and PBS broadcast it by radio nationwide.<br>
The broadcast turned out rather well and Mons. Gaviola as well as the usual friends liked it.  But my most exacting critic, Imelda, found it impressing.  I watched the replay at 9:00 PM.<br>

He still talks of some people like Mayor Cabili criticizing the proclamation of martial law as premature although grudgingly extending cooperation under Gen. Order No. 3 for all offices to continue functioning.<br>
Talk to Imee and Bongbong.  London newspaper had it I arrested the opposition, no mention of communists.<br>
And called up Sec. Romulo and Amb. Romualdez before them.  New York Times at least was sure handed and spoke of martial law after the attempt of assassination of my Secretary of National Defense.<br>

<strong>Malacañan Palace</strong><br>
<strong>Manila</strong><br>
Diokno, Chino Roces, Max Soliven etc. have filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus before the Supreme Court.<br>
I asked Justices Claudo Teehangkee, Antonio Barredo, Felix Macasiar and Felix Antonio to see us. They insisted that the government should submit to the Supreme Court for the Court to review the constitutionality of the proclamation of martial law, Proclamation No. 1081.<br>
So I told them in the presence of Secs. Ponce Enrile and Vicente Abad Santos as well as Sol. Gen. Estelito Mendoza that if necessary I would formally declare the establishment of a revolutionary government so that I can formally disregard the actions of the Supreme Court.<br>
They insisted that we retain a color of constitutionality for everything that we do.<br>
But I feel that they are still image-building and do not understand that a new day has dawned. While they claim to be for a reformed society, they are not too motivated but are too bound by technical legalism.<br>
I have amended both Gen. Orders Nos. 1 and 3 to assume all powers of government including legislative and judicial and clearly excluded cases involving the constitutionality of my acts from the jurisdiction<br>

And I signed the decree (No. 1) to promulgate the law on the Reorganization of the Government.<br>
Tomorrow I will sign the decrees promulgating the new Civil Service Rules, the Rehabilitation and Reconstruction Law, the Land Reform Funding and dismiss some judges, the CIR judges, Public Service Commission.<br>
We have impressed everybody with our fairness by the arrest of Cong. Roque Ablan, Rafael Aquino and Gov. Luis Bocalan.<br>
I have ordered profiteers to be arrested.<br>
And the ROTC boys have cleaned up the streets of graffiti.<br>

Gen. Ver’s men have apprehended Lehman the American triggerman and Manny Crisoligo the explosives and electronics man. But they have not caught Eddie Figueras, Tony Arevalo, Osmeña, Larry Truckman and others involved.<br>
The duo have involved the other men and apparently there was an agreement that the Vice President would have to take over if I were assassinated so as to prevent anarchy.<br>
But we have to check the involvement of the CIA or the U.S. Embassy, Vice Pres. Lopez and other important personalities.<br>
Apparently they have been trying to assassinate me since Baguio (in Camp John Hay) in December 1971, the Rural Bankers Convention in the Pines Hotel, the SSS Convention of Labor in May 1st.<br>
The Comby car that was prepared for the plot is indeed alarming.<br>

<strong>Malacañan Palace</strong><br>
<strong>Manila</strong><br>
Met Justices Fred Ruiz Castro and Salvador Esguerra on a consulta.<br>
I told them frankly that I needed their help and counsel because we must keep all the actuations within constitutional limits.<br>
Justice Castro asked permission to ask a blunt question, “Is this a coup d’etat?” and I told him that it is not but it is the exercise of an extraordinary power by the president for a situation anticipated by the constitution.<br>
Justice Esguerra said immediately that he feels that it is a legitimate exercise of martial law.<br>
And apparently reading my mind, he said, in the Merriman case, Justice Tannay had issued a writ of habeas corpus for a man who was detained on orders of President Lincoln. And President Lincoln just disregarded the judicial order. And Justice Tanney said, “what can we do, we are confronted by a superior authority?<br>
I then concluded that there must be no conflict between the two separate departments of Justice and Executive for it would be embarrassing to both.<br>
I believe that they are both of this persuasion.<br>

The public reaction throughout the Philippines is a welcome to martial law because of the smooth, peaceful reestablishment of peace and order and the hope of a reformed society. In fact most everyone now says, this should have been done earlier.<br>
I attach the report of Boni Isip about the same result of a survey conducted by Liberal Party Leader Gerry Roxas.<br>
It is indeed gratifying that everyone now finds or discovers I am some kind of a hero!<br>
There is nothing as successful as success!</li>

The second day without any reported crime and an almost unanimous endorsement of the proclamation of martial law.<br>
Amended Proclamation No. 1081 and Gen. Order No. 2 and issued a statement on the validity of obligations and past contracts.<br>
I attach copies.<br>
Spoke to the separate unit commanders and the major service commanders at the ceremonial hall: The proclamation of martial law is a constitutional exercise of power; it is not a coup d’etat nor military take over, it being a legitimate exercise of power, the government is a constitutional government, the reforms are necessary to win the battle because this battle is not just the battle with guns but the minds and hearts of our people, that reform will counteract subversion which is the bigger battle; that the use of media a legitimate necessity.<br>

Then finished the decree of reform and the abolition of the PSC and removal of GAB chairman Montano.<br>
In the afternoon I gave the first interview to Tillman Durdin of the New York Times and later to the UPI Vic Maliwanag and Pat Killen.<br>
They asked how long it would last –I will keep it only as long as necessary- “To dismantle the communist apparatus” and this includes the reforms I envision.<br>
For a corrupt government cannot long last -or a sick and criminally infected society.<br>
“I hope before the end of my term.”<br>
The Con Con and Congress continue. The power of the President merely augments the deficiencies.</p>

They confidently gave me information on a Carlos Selles who is supposedly being paid to assassinate me. He is supposed to be a Panamanian like a Negro and has suddenly become affluent as he is opening deposit accounts in different banks.<br>
Gen. Ver has traced his residence in Pasay and we will apprehend him for questioning.<br>

I was interviewed by John Nance and Gil Santos of AP.<br>
Traced the study of martial law to the writing of the book “Today’s Revolution -Democracy” and my revolution from the top or the center.<br>
How the present peaceful revolution is a legal exercise of force to attain revolutionary objectives.<br>
The setting and justification of a proclamation of martial law -the awakening to the threat in the Dagojo, Palawan landings, the rise in uncontrolled criminality both petty and syndicated, the paralyzation of government and business in the wake of the bombings, ambushes and the kidnappings –then the review of the captured documents and their reassessment showing that all that was happening had been planned a long time ago although the criminals were taking advantage of the confusion.<br>
And the fundamental requisite of peace and order and reform for a New Society to be created out of the chaos and helplessness that governed everyone.<br>

Joe de Venecia suggests a meeting with Gerry Roxas so that the Liberals may cooperate on the reforms. He suggested I invite Gerry to a conference tomorrow. But this may involve a compromise of our strong no-exception stance.<br>
So I have not accepted the suggestion.<br>
Everybody is saying how swiftly the peaceful revolution was accomplished. John Nance told Imelda “You did not expect it to be so neatly done.”<br>
Will it be said by history that the communist threat was just a legal justification for a legal use of force?<br>
Then let it also be said that it was a constitutional revolution –And that it was necessary to reform society — to convert a “sick society” into the “New Society.”</p>

The legitimate use of force on chosen targets is the incontestable secret of the reform movement.<br>
Restrained force will bring about the New Society.<br>
And the Reformation is coming about without any obstacle.<br>
Gerry Roxas wanted to be invited to meet with me. But the Liberal leaders all want to join up now that martial law is a success.<br>
For that matter, everyone now wants to be identified with the Reform Movement.<br>
Freddie Elizalde who has been a critic has come (brought by Adrian Cristobal) to offer a plan of indoctrination of the masses.<br>
But we already have such a plan. And this must be indoctrination by participation –inflexible justice and actual involvement.<br>
The reasons for change can be articulated later.<br>

Sec. Vicente Abad Santos on the removal of judges: He is against the outright dismissal of civil service employees.<br>
But I have decided to amend the civil service rules so as to add two new categories of punishment without going through a final hearing in addition to dismissal by an investigator. These are removal of those against whom charges are pending in which the evidence of guilt is strong and those that are notoriously undesirable so that it can be taken judicial notice of.<br>
CIR judges have been removed except Judge Veloso and Paredes.<br>
All Public Service Commissioners except Asst. Com. de Guzman also reorganized out.<br>
I have asked Dr. Genaro de Bega to request Judges Wilfrido Angeles of Quezon City, Vivencio Ruiz of Makati, Herminio Mariano of Pasig to resign.<br>
And I have dismissed 200 Customs men and 190 BIR men.<br>

Tillwan Durdin of New York Times has now reported favorably on the developments in Manila contrary to his initial reports. I attach cabled report on his story and other stories.<br>
Since the New York Times is the bell weather of American newspaper sentiment, this should mark the generally favorable reaction to martial law.<br>
This morning at 9:30 I met all the generals at Camp Aguinaldo. I cautioned them against complacency arising out of the euphoria of easy victory; to watch October a it may be the crucial month; that the reform movement and the creation of the New Society is our principal objective and keeping down criminality and prices is the urgent and immediate objective; that it is easier to win a war or a revolution (for no matter how peaceful or constitutional it is, it is a revolution) than it is to run a government; but that I am confident in their capacity to continue the excellent performance.<br>
Increased allowances of enlisted men and pay of officers.<br>

Decreased the rates of Meralco to 20.9% from 36%. This is the crying need of the people. I attach the order as well as other orders I signed today.<br>
Antonio Roxas Chua and the other sugar dealers and traders were apprehended for hoarding and profiteering. They were also getting ₱10 a bag of sugar sold to industrial users.<br>
He has offered to sell all his sugar at controlled prices. So have the others.<br>
I attach his offer through Ralph Nubla whom I authorized to see him.<br>
The Meralco oligarchs are trying to see me. The head of the clan, Eugenio Lopez Sr., has been trying to get me by telephone. Now the son (Junior) has asked to meet with Gov. Kokoy Romualdez. They sent Tony Ayala. They are also going to see Bobby Benedicto who has arrived.<br>
I am sure it is about the rates.<br>
I intend to review all power rates thoughout the Philippines.</p>

Guns, Gangsters, and the reduction of the Meralco rates –these are the news that have gone big in the United States.<br>
17,000 guns captured and surrendered is a massive number indeed which has struck the attention of the world that is preoccupied with terrorism.<br>
So too with gangsterism since it is a risk to take a stroll in Central Park or Rock Creek Park even in the daytime.<br>
And the move to dismantle the hold of the oligarchs on our economy and thus our society and government –starting out with the Lopezes’ Meralco.<br>
So we must continue the raids on the NPA safehouses for the explosives and arms we know they have.<br>
And the heroin laboratories.<br>

We are now watching the development of opposition among the clergy, possibly the nuns the Free Farmers Federation and the Christian Socialist Movement.<br>
So the opening of the schools in the high school and college levels have to be postponed. For there would be an opportunity to congregate and prepare for demonstrations.<br>
But we must not arrest any of the bishops, although we must be firm in stopping any subversion that may crop up.<br>
From abroad —<br>
I have agreed to appear in the Meet the Press show of Larry Spivak on Oct. 8, 1972 at 12:30 AM New York time which will be about midnight Sunday here.<br>

Espino and Ramos to the effect that the military has not taken over but will continue to obey the civil authority; that the people are surrendering their guns, there is peace and order and they are supporting the president to a man because they are obeying the constitution.<br>
And Lee Lescaze of the Washington Post has reversed himself and sent in a story that if a vote were taken today, an overwhelming majority of the Filipino people would support me in my decision proclaiming martial law.<br>
The support from all quarters continues and I meet the Sulu Moslem leaders who have indicated support, tomorrow at 10:00 AM.<br>

The threat from the clergy specially the Jesuits is not as bad as it first seemed.<br>
But I have ordered the release of all the clergy who have been detained to allow a review of their cases. In Greater Manila Fathers Lagermay, Floresca, and Rabang were released and have offered to help in the Reformation and the building of the New Society. In Mindanao I have ordered the release of Father Vincent Cullen in Bukidnon. Father Donelan calls him a true missionary. The same is true of the parish priest of Mons. Lino Gonzaga.<br>
Today I increased the meal allowance of enlisted men of the Armed Forces from four pesos to five pesos a day.<br>
And brought the Sulu leaders, both Nacionalista and Liberals, to pledge to support the New Society. And appeared before TV.<br>
Worked on the questions for the Spivak show next Sunday.<br>
In the evening I met Father Jose Cruz Father Rector of Ateneo University on the clergy.<br>

Fathers Floresca and Rabang both claimed they too were working for a radical change inside the church.<br>
Then met <s>the Association</s> — the Asian Press Institute of which Chino Roces is the President. I agreed to their meeting the detainees, working a Press Consultative Panel to negotiate the normalization of relationship between the government and media –it being agreed that the Consultative Panel will be composed mostly of our men in government.

Tonight I was interviewed by Wall Street Journal’s Peter Kahn. And the U.S. World and News Reports Mack Chrysler. The first is a Pulitzer Prize winner on his reporting on the Bangladesh war and the second is an old hand in Asia.<br>
The New York Times editorial of Oct. 4, 1972 said for the genuine economic &amp; social reforms “the Phil. President deserves open encouragement from the U.S. government. This could take the form of generous economic assistance for programs to help the majority of Filipinos who have profited little or not at all from 26 years of national independence”<br>

Met the leaders of the Concon delegates, Bibit Duavit, Ding Quintos and Von Yaneza on the schedule of their activities and the Interim government.<br>
The Concon through its officers and some members have requested ₱4.5 million for their expenses up to January which I granted. This means that even Pres. Macapagal recognizes the legality of my legislating by decree.<br>

Are you one of the wealthiest men in the Philippines and Asia?<br>

Earl Mayo said over long distance that “The President threw them out of the ballpark.”<br>
And Mr. Sharon said, “They did not touch him at all. He was too fast.”<br>
And here “Talagang magaling.” This is from Gagalangin.<br>
This morning I met the Oil corporation executives on oil exploration. We are going to open the government reserves and to the discoverer of oil the government collects only 12 1/2% royalty and 50% tax on the net income and on all succeeding explorers 15% royalty and a 50% tax on net oncome.

This will certainly revolutionize our society and create an immediate impact on the economy.</p>

And finally 20 minutes interview by correspondent Mr. Saito of the Asahi Shimbun.<br>
Practically the same questions on martial law.<br>
ABC and CBS will mean millions more of listeners and viewers. I was able to put in the points: the landing in Palawan, invisible government, front organizations, urban guerrillas and better yet –that we have been fighting since the war– and our children will not fight the same battles all over again.<br>

<strong>Malacañan Palace</strong><br>
<strong>Manila</strong><br>
The Cotobato (North) leaders, Moslem Tururays and Christian alike, have pledged to keep the peace and support me in the proclamation of martial law and the reformation.<br>
But since fighting has broken out in the Magsanoy, Ampatuan, Pikit area I have called them to Manila — (all the provincial and municipal officials). I personally asked Cong. Salipada Pendatun to come over the telephone when I told talked to him after my opening appeal wherein I told the leaders that Mindanao is Moslem land and we, the Christians, are there because of their tolerance and their invitation; that the Christians should therefore help their brother Moslems and other minorities who are less prepared for an exacting modern world; that the policies I have established favor the Moslem areas; most of the money we have borrowed from abroad go to Mindanao, the seaports and airports being developed are in Mindanao; the “Investments below the typhoon belt policy” means investments will pour in for Mindanao and Sulu, and the oil exploration program will favor Mindanao and Sulu, the number of schools being constructed now in these islands are double that of the Luzon and Visayas areas.<br>
So I concluded “I am ready to wipe out all past records and start out with the slate<br>
2<br>

<strong>Manila</strong><br>
clean provided that there will be no repetition of the past offenses.” And pointed out to how I had personally gone to Buldon to stop the Armed Forces of the Philippines from decimating that Moslem town under Mayor Aratuc (his son Tonatic had been sent by the father who was taken ill campaigning for the people’s support of martial law) with artillery fire notwithstanding the seven casualties suffered by the government troops.<br>
We ended up with Cong. Salipada Pendatun reiterating support for my program and agreeing to head a mission to contact Ex-Gov. Udtog Matalam whose MIM forces have started the fighting to come to see me in Manila. But we have to stop the operations of the AFP against his band in the meantime.<br>
And Datu Akilan Ampatuan will contact the two Sanki brohers, Abdullah and Balacat and son A   to also come and see me. So too with the old man Datu Kadanding who have apparently joined Datu Udtog Matalam.<br>
The Disumimba band which threatens Dinaig is composed of outlaws and will have to be destroyed.<br>

Met Congs. Armi Gustilo of Negros and Eduardo Cojuangco of Tarlac. They report 105 armed men have gone up the mountains in Negros and their transit point to Panay where they have contact with some other subversives is through Guimaras through a certain Jayme.<br>
We will mount a special intelligence and search and destroy operations.<br>
They also showed a telegram of Sugar Administrator Jose Unson for all sugar people on planters and millers to pass their sugar through the Producers Cooperative controlled by Ex Sec. Alfredo Montelibano by a voting trust agreement who is apparently trying to corner the sugar market.<br>
I have called all planters and millers next Wednesday at 10:30 AM so I can organize a government sugar commission to handle exports and domestic sales.<br>
I met with Justice Fred Ruiz Castro. He has told the Chief Justice of my request that there be no direct confrontation between me and the Supreme Court. Justice Castro called attention to the fact that in all the cases they have studied, the U.S. Supreme Court decided the cases after martial law was over. I believe they will do this.<br>

<strong>Manila</strong><br>
I have asked the Justices to help in preparing a list of CFI and CAR judges whose resignations should be accepted.<br>
And reforms in the judiciary –or for that matter the whole society.<br>
But I believe we still should look into how the Lopez interests (Meralco) have been paying the children and relatives of the justices.<br>
And the payrolls are in the Meralco offices  of the comptroller, the treasurer and personal secretaries of Mr. Eugenio Lopez.<br>
The last article of Richard Critchfeld in the Washington Star is most laudatory: It is about the book (my book) calling it the best analysis of why I imposed martial law “It is a brilliantly-reasoned manifesto calling for a government-led 1. non-violent revolution to fundamentally remake Philippine society xxx The book provides the political theory and the blue-print of what Marcos is doing now xxx”<br>

“It is perhaps one of the most extraordinary theoretical documents ever produced by a contemporary non-communist head of state.”<br>
xxx<br>
“Marcos book, taken together with all he has been saying and doing since he declared martial law, puts the present crisis into an altogether different perspective. Far from being a short-term emergency or a routine power play, it is a far greater and more dangerous enterprise.”<br>
“Marcos is pitting himself, the Army, the technocrats and other modernizing forces against the entrenched oligarchy, the communists, the radical left and the Philippine criminal underworld in a prolonged struggle to decide whether this country can afford to remain an open society.”</p>

I have about ₱50 million for the organization of cooperatives and loans for them. Sec. Melchor told me this morning before the conference that the AID is ready to raise $50 million for land reform. I would put it into the Land Ownership financing.<br>
So I have set the guidelines for acquisition of land for the tenants.<br>
Then I met the Catholic bishops who explained the second letter which expressed reservations about martial law and my decrees was signed by 17 bishops most of whom were misled into thinking they signed the first resolution of support.<br>

I have finally decided that in the Land Reform Program we should keep the government out of the transaction for the transfer of ownership of the land to the tenant. It would be a direct transaction between landowner and tenant choosing one of two schemes:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5821" data-line-end="5822">Payment in 14 years of 25% of the decided rent. This would be guaranteed by the cooperative that would have to be organized before ownership can be transferred to the tenant.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="5822" data-line-end="5843">The organization of a corporation 25% of which shall belong to the landowner.<br>
And there will be 0-retention by the landowner –except where the landowner tills the land himself– so he retains 6 hectares for each member of the family.<br>
I attach the notes on our conference.<br>
The use of bonds I rejected as this involves ₱7.5 billion at ₱5,000 per hectare.<br>
Met Amb. Byroade at 9:45 AM who congratulated me. I asked him to inform his government I am asking for help in Land Reform. He feels that he can obtain such help from the U.S. Congress.<br>

Then worked on new schools to be opened, the amendments to the orders on suspension and dismissal of policemen, the take over of IISMI and Elirol, the exclusion of clearance requirements for certain groups of persons.<br>
Tonight I viewed the media presentations of two groups –the APAA and the Tony Cantero groups.<br>
I met Eraño Manalo of the Iglesia ni Cristo. He is worried that he may be picked up. And the BIR just notified him his books of accounts would be examined. Of course I accepted the resignation of Judge Herminio Moreno, married to his sister.<br>

And in the early morning of Saturday, Sept. 22nd, shooting erupted in the Central Building of the Iglesia in Quezon City, beside the U.P. resulting in the death of one Iglesia guard and the wounding of three more while on the government side three marines were wounded. And he claims it was due to the fact that the Metrocom team head who was asked what they wanted by an Iglesia man, Ka Esguerra (a Lt. Ilagan who was apparently nervous) did not show his written orders nor did he explain his mission. Only the call of Sec. Ponce Enrile stopped the shooting.<br>
He claims that the NPA would be trying to win their men to their side. But that they could not join a Godless organization.<br>
I believe he is scared of being picked up.</li>

Spent the whole day from noon to midnight in the boat. Had a two hour nap after lunch and finished four books on Nehru, Nasser, Indo China and some histories.<br>
Quite a relief from the routine of the palace. And the moldy decaying air replaced by the fresh ocean breeze.<br>
This morning Gen. Ver called up from the home of Cong. Pendatun in Cotobato City to inform me that they might not be able to return today as they would like to pick up the Alontos in Lanao as well as the other Moslem leaders other than Ex-Gov. Udtog Matalam, Datu Kudanding, the Sangki brothers, Abdullah and Balacat as we all Abdullah’s son. So I will wait for them tomorrow.<br>
My impression of Nehru and Nasser was that they belong to the improvising leaders like Quezon and Osmeña to whom we ascribe many of our present day problems.</p>

I have had to postpone the proclamation of ownership of the land they till by the tenants because of my desire to prevent the dislocation of production if small farmers owning only 6 hectares are dispossessed of their lands and merely transferred to what may be a less efficient tenant.<br>
So I have asked for more statistics on how many landowners there are owning give hectares or less.<br>
I was interviewed by Tony Clifton of Newsweek and H. Okada of the Japan Economic Review.<br>

Ex-Foreign Minister Kiichi Aichi, personal representative of Prime Minister Tanaka of Japan arrived yesterday and conferred with me on the Japan-People’s Republic of China normalization of diplomatic relations, this morning.<br>
I emphasized the security aspect more than the economic aspect. Since the agreement is similar to the U.S.-Red China communique in that it considers the question of Taiwan internal to China to be decided between Red China and Nationalist China,  Taiwan would probably become a part of Red China and be our next door neighbor. Red China like Nationalist China would then claim the Spratley Islands and further raise a source of quarrel with the Philippines.<br>
I asked Japan to support our position that the Spratley Islands are Trust Territories and that Taiwan should be defended by American Forces in force is used by Red China to settle the question.<br>
I attach my notes.<br>

Just arrived from the informal dinner given by Pres. and Mrs. Watanabe of the Asian Development Bank. Only Sec. &amp; Mrs. Alex Melchor, Sec and Mrs. Cesar Virata and ADB Vice Pres. Krisna Moortli were present. Pres. Watanabe is retiring Dec. 25th.<br>
It was a pleasant dinner with much story telling punctuated by laughter.<br>
Proclaimed the emancipation of the tenant-farmer this morning. I attach a copy of my proclamation or decree. This should cause the actual start of the Reformation.<br>
And gave a 1st month report of martial law.<br>
Then met the labor leaders, the rural bankers, the governor, Liberal leaders and mayors of Masbate.<br>

the PC patrol they ambushed.<br>
Camp Keithley in Marawi City is under attack by a band of outlaws who have taken over the MSU radio, raised the red flag and surrounded the PC Prov. Hq. of Maj. Marolomsar, Prov. Commander. Eight of our men have been killed (six outright at Pantar Bridge that leads to the city from Iligan) and one wounded while nine have been killed on the enemy side and one captured who is being interrogated.<br>
Reinforcements being rushed to the besieged forces.<br>

I believe the attackers may be a combination of student radicals (KM and SDK) supported by outlaws. The red flag may show they are communist infiltrated or controlled.<br>
And again this may be a diversion from the Luzon front where the communists are hard pressed.<br>
Or a demonstration that the leaders I talked to and placated like the Alontos and Pendatun do not run things anymore.<br>
Or again this may be a Pendatun and Alonto play to gain a stronger bargaining position.<br>
But we are not going to bargain. We will hit them hard.</p>

I just talked to Gen. Ramos, Gen. Encarnacion and Lancaf Task Force Commander Col. Zafra by SSB. Attached list of request.<br>
It turns out the rebels are followers of the former Chief of Police dismissed by Mayor Omar Dianalan, Zakar and a former BIR man also dismissed for being notoriously undesirable. They both have 200 men each.<br>
They sought to isolate Marawi City by taking Pantar Bridge over the Agos River and burning the wooden portion. Then they took the MSU radio and sought to rally the people to their side. But the people did not respond because the mayors who had just seen me</p>

And the swift retaliatory action by our reinforcements employing mortars and the recoil-less rifles — the 106 and 3.5 mm (the latter were first employed by the marine company in Pantar bridge when the rebels in full force blocked the road with two panel wagons. The marines suffered five WIA in that encounter.<br>
The rebels attacked Marawi and the surrounded PC Prov. Hq. at 4:00 AM and 8:00 AM this morning. They were repulsed again.<br>
As of tonight there is still sporadic firing and another attack is expected. We are sending two more companies tomorrow. And this includes one company from the PSC –the Special Forces company of 100 officers and men.<br>

The Japanese Recovery Team for the Japanese straggler in Lubang Island arrived this afternoon at 2:30 PM with 42 Japanese correspondents. They were ferried by C-47 and will be supported by heli tomorrow when the brother of the survivor Lt. Ouada will try to locate him and drop leaflets as well as appeal to him by loudspeaker.<br>
The Japanese correspondents will probably be interested in the escape of the Japanese ambassador from Marawi now.</p>

Had a fruitful meeting with the Episcopal Commission on Social Action. Imelda helped me. She charmed them.<br>
Mons. Labayen headed them. He started out to explain when I asked that instead of sniping at each other from a distance we now join hands to attain our common objectives and maintain a line of communications.<br>
His explanation was that since before martial law since the purpose was to shock the establishment into action some of the things they did and said had to be extreme. But that since martial law was bringing about their desired ends of reform then it was time for them to change their tactics. And this would require a continuous dialogue.<br>
They asked the opening of more stations (radio) the publication of the magazine Impact the magazine which is the channel for Social Doctrine in Southeast Asia and help on the release of some of their members and workers.<br>

While our reforms programs are moving ahead of schedule I am worried about the expected huge deficits.<br>
So we must save at least 10% of the budget. (Gov’t) Income has decreased because of the floods. So we must crack down on the tax evaders and smugglers, improve the tax collection efficiency, increase some taxes and borrow some money from domestic and foreign sources.<br>

on the instructions of Sec. of State Rogers to arrange the transhipment of 90 F5 jet fighters to Vietnam beginning tonight up to Nov. 15th. I agreed provided that this does not violate the conditions of the Vietnam Treaty of Peace.<br>
Amb. Byroade had anticipated my question on this and wired the State Dept. Rogers answered that the shipment was going to be finished by Nov. 15th before the “effectivity of the Treaty” and would not violate the conditions of the peace treaty. This should mean that the Treaty would not be effective until after the elections in the U.S.<br>
Although I observed there may be a ceasefire before then –indicating that the Americans may be treading on dangerous ground but that we were willing to help. He also said that the shipments may come and go boxed in their flying boxcars.<br>

Our people will never know the gamble that I have taken when I proclaimed martial law.<br>
For I deliberately diverted the possible enemy fire to myself so as to save our people.<br>
Martial law is a limitation of freedom and, therefore, generally objectionable. There were too many factors that were imponderable. How would the people react? Would they take up arms against us? The number of firearms surrendered (Now about 280,000) indicate that if they did take up arms they would have overwhelmed us including the Armed Forces of the Philippines.<br>
The international press and world public opinion would be against us. And I would be the principal target.<br>
And the American government was probably going to be against it.<br>
Even the military had not all committed themselves to the program.</p>

The American attitude of sacrificing everybody else for their national interest as they did with Taiwan and now South Vietnam shows that if we had made just one mis-step, they would have turned against us.<br>
But it seems to me that we have overcome all these difficulties –after one month and eleven days.<br>
In view of the probability that the Constitution will be finished by the Concon by the end of November and submitted to a plebiscite by January 15, 1973 I have decided to call the congressional leaders to a luncheon conference on Thursday.<br>
Received Speaker Villareal, Doroy Valencia, Cong. Danding Cojuangco, Mike Stilianopoulos, Tony Madrigal (the last two for appointment to ambassador to the Quirinal and the Vatican<br>

I could not write my diary yesterday as I had an operation by Dr. Mathay for hernia in the eye through the supraorbital and infra orbital fascia<br>
resulting in fat collecting in the muscles resulting in bags or distortion of the lower lids as wll as drooping upper eyelids which has caused me eye strain and headaches.<br>
The operation started at 8:20 AM and ended way beyond 12:00 AM yesterday.<br>
The local anesthesia that was used was not used with adrenain and so did not last too long. Part of the operation was done in exquisite pain specially the suturing.<br>
But I refused to take Demerol and other hypnotics as I do not wish to take any drugs that may affect my mentation.<br>
Then I had a bad allergy from the antiseptic used on my face. My skin burned. But I did not tell the doctor until after</p>

The religious were prepared to demand a consultative panel to help draft the decrees, orders and instructions. This was the plan of the religious superiors –the nuns.<br>
But at the start of the conference with them by the cabinet I anticipated with the statement that I was of the belief that neither the clergy nor the government wanted to have the impression that the church and churchmen are intervening and participating in the running of government.<br>
So they limited themselves to constructive proposals on the plebiscite, land reform<br>

Just arrived from the Nayon Pilipino on the showing of Bagong Anyo ’72 which was a great success although the computerized slides did not work because of the lowering of power just as they were about to be used. For the show started about 6:00 PM when about everybody turned on their lights in Manila.<br>
But nobody noticed it except those who knew that the five slides were supposed to flash simultaneously.<br>
And by the sheer number of creations of the 42 coutouriers (from local materials it is true but lovely nonetheless) was impressive and overwhelming.<br>
The Bayanihan dancers presented the various old costumes from which the coutoriers drew their inspiration.<br>
And as the Bayanihan dancers withdrew, the models came in to the tune of modern music and modern creations.<br>
I left Imelda at the Nayon still annoyed about the slides.<br>

Most important is the plan to change the name of the Philippines since King Philip after whom our country is named was not such a model of a king to be proud of.<br>
Tagalo, Manila, Rizalia, Silangan, Maganda, Kayumanggi, Maharlika were suggested. The last seems the most favored.<br>
The recommendations of the Senate and House were rejected. This includes choosing the Vice President as President, the Senate President as Speaker of the new National Assembly, and the Speaker as Majority Floor Leader.<br>
We put flexibility into the economic provisions by allowing the State to enter into treaties about alien participation.</p>

The actuations of the Americans before the elections generated the fear that the U.S. was so tired of war that the American people were willing to buy peace at any price — even at the price of being a second class power, or second in military might to others.<br>
But the victory of Nixon, I hope, will change all this. For peace in Asia or for that matter the world may depend on the credibility of the U.S. commitments and agreements.<br>

Although I do not believe we can expect much in the way of military aid <s>although</s> we may be able to get some economic aid for Land Reform.<br>
Gov. Kokoy Romualdez just talked to me by long distance telephone. He tells me that Pres. Nixon seems to be following what I am doing — asking for discipline, reorganizing the government, resignation of the officers. But that seems logical.<br>
Today I worked on the exports problems — GATT, LTA (Long Term Agreements on Textiles) EEC-ASEAN consultations. Asked Sec. Cesar Virata and T. Quiazon to work on them and submit reports.<br>
Imelda and I loafed around all morning.<br>

She watched the Bagong Anyo ’72 on TV in the afternoon with her friends. I went to Pangarap to play golf but it started to drizzle so I exercised indoors, had a long massage and talked to Imee by long distance to wish her a Happy Birthday. She was at the Del Mar, a beach house for the nuns at her school in Sta. Catalina. She is 17 today.<br>
I attach the cable we sent her.</p>

I write this at 8:30 AM<br>
Dec. 18, 1972 because I went<br>
to bed at 12:00 p.m. feeling heavy<br>
and sore in the muscles. Just<br>
tired and sleepy as I slept only<br>
five hours the night before<br>
and had practically no nap in the<br>
afternoon.<br>
December 17, 1972<br>
Sunday<br>
Bongbong and Irene arrived by PAL in the evening at 7:32 p.m. We met them at the VIP Room. Bongbong’s hair had been cut short by Amb. Jayme Zobel’s secretary, Salazar, on the prodding’s of Bea, the ambassador’s wife. Irene was smart in a red, white and blue suit with a red tie and red bordered vest-armless sweater under a coat. They both look healthy and happy. Bongbong read during the long trip — a novel and a book on relativity! Irene slept and ate only one meal.<br>
Imelda’s stitches, including the long subcuticular stitch at the right forearm that held the muscles together – and without anesthesia at 11:00 a.m. – 12:30 a.m.<br>
After the attack on Imelda, while she was suffering from her fresh wounds I started to think if the reforms of our society and the Filipino people are worth all these sacrifices.<br>
And the answer is “yes, if the reforms will finds rest among our people.”<br>
But in Manila I am beginning to see the signs of a shipping back to the old habits.<br>
There is cleanliness in the city, much less crime, a new attitude by civil servants, a general concern for the general welfare.<br>
But frivolity is still apparent among the upper classes. Still a habit for conspicuous consumption, selfishness and appearance. One feels this arrogance also among the intelligentsia towards the ignorant and the less fortunate.<br>
The rich are still thinking in terms of quick unreasonable profits, how to escape the law, avoid taxes.<br>
Some criminals are back to their trade and the radicals are regrouping.<br>
The politicians are beginning to be as demanding (Cong. Masias kept insisting on the congressions receiving their salaries immediately after the ratification of the new constitution) as before. This is because they know we need them for the ratification of the new constitution.<br>
And the Liberal Party leadership of Roxas, Salonga, Felipe, Eva Estrada Kalaw, John Osmeña, Daza, Barrera, Soc Rodrigo are banding together for obstructionism all over agaln.<br>
The Comelec has assumed an attitude it is more powerful than the military and perhaps the president.<br>
The quiet, slow slide into the old society is now perceptible.<br>
And a deliberate attempt to erode the authority of martial law.<br>
Even Mao Tse Tung spoke of the return of reaction in a letter to his wife several years after the 1949 victory of his revolution. Thus, the need of the Cultural Revolution.<br>
Probably we will need more stern measures after the ratification of the constitution. It seems as if liberality is mistaken for weakness in a centralist or authoritarian government no matter how constitutional.<br>
We need a longer period of gestation of the New Society. Otherwise it will be aborted.<br>
And more care and alertness by the leadership for the symptoms of retrogression.<br>

On board the 777 on the way to Currimao,<br>
locos Norte from Agoo, La Union which we<br>
left at 11:00 p.m. We are having a beautiful<br>

I am in the South looking over the local<br>
situation after Gov. Udtod Matalam reparation.<br>
December 27, 1972<br>
Wednesday<br>
Left Manila about 8:30 p.m. Had engine trouble (bolt of the rocker arm of the right engine loosened) at about 11:30 p.m. south of Subic Bay.<br>
Arrived off the Hundred Islands at 10:30 a.m. this morning. Bongbong and Miguelito were already skiing around the ship when I went up to the deck.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6432" data-line-end="6438">Went Quezon Island about two miles off, took the helicopter with Imee and Irene and Imelda with Bongbong and Miguelito in the other and flew around the string of islands that look like mushrooms on the sea or green snails on top of the blue water. Then skied with Bongbong around the islands. Lunch in the windy island on lobster, crabs, shrimps, ararusip, banac, armang and fresh tomatoes.<br>
Gifts for everyone. Maligayang Pasko bags and wallets. Then left for Agoo at about 3:00 p.m. Bongbong and Miguelito skiing all the way to the ship.<br>
Arrived off Agoo at about 4:10 p.m. Ticklish operation for Imelda to negotiate ship to shore (PC to the power boat then carried on a chair to shore).<br>
The nipa house at Sta. Rita, Ago is a haven. Wide long beach, cool air, friendly people, isolated from the town and fresh sea food — malaga, armang (the smallest shrimps) eel; and frogs, marungay – fresh coconuts.<br>
Joe Aspiras, Gen. Guerrero, Tiling Ortega and Mayor Ferrera were there.<br>

On board the 777, on the way to<br>
San Fernando, La Union having left<br>
Gang Pier at about 11:15 p.m.<br>
December 28, 1972<br>
Thursday<br>
Docked at Gaang Port, Currimao, Ilocos Norte at about 7:00 a.m. Left by car at 9:15 p.m. for the 400th year celebration of the implementation of Christianity in the locos by Salcedo. Delivered my speech at 12:00 a.m… Imelda cut the ribbon for the mini-fair at 12:30 a.m. Blessing of the cross at Ermita hill at 12:45 a.m., the chandeliers and cathedral improvement at 1:00 p.m. and conferred with Messrs. Nelson (Caltex in charge of drilling outside of the U.S.) Ray Johnson, Philippine Caltex head and others for Caltex and Sec. Bing Tanco and Chairman Ting Paterno of BOI. Then returned to the ship for lunch. By that time the ambassadors were in the ship, the luncheon prepared at Gabut by Elizabeth having been a fiasco. So a second luncheon was prepared on board the ship.<br>
We had told everybody that I had planed in from Mindanao to catch up with the affair while Imelda came to locos by boat. And that I was going back to Manila by plane in the afternoon.<br>
Bongbong and the boys skied up to 6:00 from 3:30 p.m. Imelda went to inspect the site of the bamboo beach house in Currimao, the church in Paoay which she will rehabilitate, the site of fathers memorial at Billoca Lake, Batac, the house in Batac and visited Tia Barang.<br>
We followed her to the Batac and invited my old cronies to come to the ship for dinner.<br>
We had fun reliving the good old days when I was still congressman. And we (Imelda and I) later regaled the children, to the accompaniment of much laughter, with stories of the “smokers” the professionals would put up on “Innocents Day” — Dec. 28th, when I was still a congressman.<br>
With Dr. Eugenio Mendoza as an angel raised up to the ceiling as an angel and we could not bring him down, so he dangled above the scenery for some time apropos to nothing that was going on the stage in a supposed drama in the meantime.<br>
Or the time he came on stage as a lady having borrowed Imelda’s terno.<br>
And in the comedian or moro-moro I was emperor but I would secretly double as the clown and belabor everyone with my stick physically and with my tongue with wisecracks.<br>
On the political campaigns when the cash was never enough and we would bluff our way through. And Kokoy getting beaten up at Dugras or Tony Raquiza being surrounded in Bacarra by goons.<br>
Andres Nurasal the man who was tortured by the old Dept. of Investigation to testify against me and refused (in 1939) has been suspended by Elizabeth from the provincial guards. I directed his reinstatement.<br>
Mang Pedong Layasan Acting Mayor of Bangui, who also was tortured and accused but acquitted before me for the Nalundasan murder has suffered a heart attack and in Intensive care of the UE Hospital.<br>
So far no bad news from Mindanao or anywhere else.<br>
The feeling for the continuance of martial law seems unanimous because of peace and order prevailing and the elimination of corruption as well as the improper use of wealth.<br>
I am all the more resolved to indefinitely postpone the plebiscite, suspend the sessions of Congress and call a referendum by citizens assemblies.<br>
Thoughts from my speech at Laoag.<br>
“Man lives by symbols”<br>
“All revolution whether constitutional or bloody are finally aimed at changing the heart, the soul and spirit of man. Thus the importance of religion and faith.”<br>
“What we lack in material resources we make up with spiritual values.”<br>
The story has come full cycle. For Asia which gave birth to the worlds great religion received the modified version of those religious.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6480" data-line-end="6483">FM and Romulo have stressed need for national security measures in light of probable end of Vietnam war, according to the papers. The trouble with the chief representatives of the ruling class – like FM and Romulo – is that they are so fond of using the term “national” in such phrases as “national security,” “national interest,.” “national objectives,” etc.<br>
When they mouth the term “national security,” what they actually mean is security of the privileged ruling class and its American masters in this country. When they say “national interests,” they actually mean the vested interests of the ruling class and its alien masters. When they say “national objectives,” they actually mean the goals of <em>big business</em>and <em>agrarian overlords</em>to further entrench and consolidate their economic and political hold (“stranglehold” seems to be more descriptive) on the people’s livelihood and economic servitude.<br>
In a nutshell, one must consider such excellent “patriotic” rhetoric in terms of class interest. “National security” should read “ruling class security,” “national interests” should read “ruling class interests,” “national objectives” should read “ruling class objectives,” etc., etc., ad nauseam.</p>

…Chief Justice Concepcion is sick in the hospital and may not be able to attend the dinner on Monday.<br>
It is apparent that the other justices are in favor of dismissing the petition questioning the validity of the ratification of the New Constitution.<br>
But they want to be assured of their continuance in office under the new constitution with new appointments…<br>
But everybody else has accepted the new constitution and as we put it in the dinner conference we held tonight, how do the justices expect us to “unscramble the eggs already scrambled”?<br>
We have to handle them with finesse as the Supreme Court might become the rallying point of the opponents of reform.</p>

…The dilemma of all the developing countries is still freedom in its traditional concept or survival.<br>
Perhaps too simplistic but true. In our case survival (physically) from the anarchy, violence, and chaos of actual rebellion…<br>
In our case, too, providentially, there was written into our constitution the power to proclaim martial law which would authorize not only an assurance of flexibility in eradicating the rebellion but of instituting reforms that would prevents its recurrence and create a new society…</p>

With the country and people moving forward steadily, investments coming in, confidence reinstated, people hopeful and achieving, there is pride for our Republic and nation.<br>
And many people are beginning to claim they had known all along that martial law was the only solution.<br>
Occasionally, however, some people feel that we are back in the Old Society and suggest I share in the profits and material rewards of the civil order I have been able to reestablish.<br>
Poor, deluded souls! They cannot seem to realize that to steer this country through these critical days, I have to be above the material attractions that have a tendency to claim you and enmesh you in petty and selfish interests.<br>
To keep the objectivity and wisdom of judgment that is necessary for leadership, I must stay away from these mundane considerations.</p>

The fighting in Mindanao and Sulu may delay our economic and social development plans.<br>
But it is probably providential that it happened this early and the Maoists (Nur Misuari, Jassmi Salamat and others) took over the leadership.<br>
It could have been a messy, tedious dirty long series of small attritional skirmishes. But instead they have massed and sought to overrun our detachments and units succeeding in some.<br>
We have been able to mark out fallen [illegible], pin them down and inflict casualties comparatively impossible in the Luzon campaign.<br>
Rather cold-blooded –but this will [illegible] the conflict specially if we can push them to the negotiating table as we have in Sulu.</p>

I have authorized Col. Alcoseba to make a make-believe landing in Maimbung to draw the rebels occupying the town into the open to defend the beach and so they can be hit by naval gunfire and air strike.<br>
I attach copy of instructions to the chief of staff.<br>
It seems that Indanan has been occupied, after Maimbung. Parang is under threat and South Ubian, an island to the south, has also been occupied.<br>
But we cannot mount an attach with only three battalions in Sulu. The 2.000 special policeman are not ready. They are mostly armed with carbines. And no match to the rebels.<br>
So we keep feinting and hitting the rebels with navy guns and airplanes when we can get them out in the open away from the civilians</p>

Am now reading The Revolution and the Civil War in Spain by Pierre Broue and Emile Temine.<br>
That a civil war followed the Generals Revolution was due to the strong communist organization supported by the socialists who finally joined up with them — and the support by Russia of the “Republicans” although Frances Falangists or “Nationalists” were supported by Germany and Italy.<br>
The book marks out how much against their wish the Communists by their predeliction to violence created the need for the “Generals Revolution” and again constituted the final opposition to the Revolution.<br>
This should be a lesson to us.<br>
In the conference which I held with the “Originals” (with Col. , the J-3, and Gen. Tamayo, Chief of Logistics included) at 4:30 PM. Saturday April 14th. I informed them:<br>
(1) That I had written a Political Testament which I directed them to follow, indicating the successor to me in case of my death or disability; that this was necessary in view of the fact that even now there was rivalry among various leaders, that it was necessary to continue our policies even if I should not be capable or around to lead<br>
otherwise our constitutional revolution would ultimately fail; that even Alexander’s empire had broken up because he had failed to appoint a successor and on his death bed when queried had merely said, “To the strongest” belongs his empire; and that I assessed the various personalities aspiring for leadership.<br>
(2) There was need to renew our pledge to our commitment because there is an apparent weakening of the elements of our revolution. A corruption and loss of ideals has set in. This is a repetition of my warnings specially to PC Chief, Gen. Ramos. He called a command conference. Example: Extortion by PC in Surigao Sur of Georgia Pacific.<br>
Thus the CG of Metrocom, Gen. Alfredo Montoya is reported openly and publicly embracing and kissing an Australian blonde in the golf links of Wack Wack while his security men running his golf cart where he and his lady love came to a landing, thereby publicly calling attention to the indiscretion. This was supposed to have taken place month ago and was confirmed by Bert Sabido, an eyewitness, and Mining Disini.<br>
(3) The critique of the Mindanao, Sulu operations. It involves a change from small unit deep penetration operations to larger unit employment and Inter Service coordination specially air and navy.<br>
(4) Our policies —<br>
We should allow the rebels to continue the mistake of trying to hold ground thus lose their mobility.<br>
The rebels should be lured to fight a conventional war and concentrate forces so they can be hit by all services as a profitable target.<br>
The government plan is to concentrate forces (actually 5 to 7 battalions) in each province in the order of priority and liquidate the rebellion in that order.<br>
In the meantime we should not be lured to fight a war of attrition or to send out small patrols as we did in Luzon.<br>
Even Sulu has to wait. For the order of priority is 1. Cotabato 2. Basilan 3. Zamboanga Sur if it has deteriorated 4. Sulu.<br>
In the meantime, our forces in Sulu must contain the enemy and keep it occupied or off-balance.<br>
The three battalions now in Basilan should be sufficient to finish the campaign there.<br>
I have noticed a tendency of the officers and men to utilize the tactics they learned in Luzon almost invariably even when meeting a massed enemy in a set-piece conventional situation. This has resulted in casualties if not total liquidation of small squad-strength units.</p>

Monday<br>
While the meditations and prayers seem routine and a poor concession to religion or the church I find them conducive to the humility that gives a new – ever new perspective.<br>
For my part while in everyday life I do seek the Godly point of view, the perspective is all the more refreshing.<br>
And the over view of life as well as the conversations with God set a firmer guidelines that may have escaped attention.<br>
Solutions of intractable problems seem simple.<br>
One of my advisers wrote to me of spiritual retreats that I should not be in the company of my subordinates. I must tell him when I see him that one cannot call God a subordinate! For that is the company I keep.<br>
Cyrus L. Sulzberger in the New York Times and the International Herald Tribune writes in his column about “Another Strong Man in Asia”. For once we are reported about our reforms — “he has hauled the Philippines out of stagnation”. Quite favorable. More than any I have read so far.<br>
I attach the April 11th edition of the Herald Tribune in which the writing appears.<br>
Some of the advisers of Pres. Nixon who have talked to Gov. Benjamin Romualdez have reported that Pres. Nixon has wryly commented that if martial law could bring about the laudable effects seen in the Philippines, then it is needed in the U.S.<br>
The military report favorable results of clearing operations in Cotabato and Basilan although there is no report on the threat to Jolo by an enemy concentration 2 kilometers from that town.<br>
The Goodrich plantation in Basilan has been recovered.<br>
I attach reports. <br>
Anaconda Co. has a new non-pollution chemical process of drawing out copper from the ore. Many U.S. copper producers including Anaconda Co. itself (in Montana) are faced with stiff pollution laws in Western mining states to control the heavy sulfur dioxide emissions from heat-process smelters. The Anaconda process uses an ammonia- based “leach” that does not produce any air pollution emissions.<br>
Before I allow the establishment of any copper smelter by Lepanto or Atlas, must look into the Anaconda process and the problem of pollution.<br>
Then, I must look into the possibility of making the Philippines a tax haven for foreign corporation like Luxembourg.</p>

In the May 28th issue of the Newsweek, Washington Editor and Publisher of Indonesia Raya western Mindanao and Sulu fighting in the article, the generally balanced and [illegible] coments certain [illegible]:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6821" data-line-end="6824">He writes “Some time ago, Manila came to suspect strongly that Sabah was giving the Muslim rebels in Sulu both arms and training. At one time, in fact, it looked as if Manila were ready to denounce Kuala Lumpur publicly for helping the rebels. Ultimately, however, caution prevailed in Manila — to the extent that recently Philippine Foreign Minister Carlos Romulo effectively cleared Kuala Lumpur of any involvement.<br>
We did not expect [illegible] aid for the Muslim rebels. We had evidence of it of statements of captured rebels, infiltration agents and pictures of training camps and captured arms.<br>
Romulo never made such a statement.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6824" data-line-end="6833">He also writes, “In this connection, it is most unfortunate that Marcos has had to resort to arming Phlippine Christians in Mindanao and the Sulu Archipelago and has thrown them into battle alongside the Philippine Army. This inevitably increases Muslim fears of a complete Christian domination. One can only hope Marcos will see the futility of the continued use of force and will try to restore peace in the region through negotiations.<br>
There are no Christians in the Self-Defense Units fighting the Muslim rebels in the Sulu Archipelago. All the volunteers are Muslims.<br>
In Mindanao the Self-Defense Units are Muslim and Christian.<br>
The article shows ignorance of the efforts for negotiations to end the fighting. Before we fought back, we asked to negotiate. The Muslim rebels refused. We had to fight to bring them to the negotiating table.<br>
The article is patronizing and [illegible] ignorant of the development plans for the Muslims and their provinces.<br>

Wednesday I spent on the problem of negotiations with the Malaysians on the conflict in the South which involves Sabah.<br>
The morning I dedicated to reviewing the situation and the documents as well as dictating the briefing for the military (generals and colonels) whom I met from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM and the Foreign Policy Council whom I had invited at 8:30 PM. I had dinner with all of them at the Heroes Hall I attach the briefing papers.<br>
After asking ex- Vice Pres. and Sen. Pelaez to submit his report (which I attach and which he read) I asked the observations of Sec. Romulo, Pres. Macapagal &amp; Sen. Pres. Puyat, Speaker Villareal.<br>
Then I decided:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6876" data-line-end="6877">Since it was the Philippines that asked for the negotiations to gain time, we have already benefited from it because the threat to publicly expose the Malaysian intervention stopped the flow of arms, thus leaving us free to liquidate the insurgency which was not resupplied from Sabah.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6877" data-line-end="6878">And so we must continue the negotiations so we can gain more time.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6878" data-line-end="6879">But we should keep the negotiations going until September during which period we should liquidate the insurgency.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6879" data-line-end="6880">We should study how we can adopt the suggestion of Ex-Pres. Macapagal which, of course, I have originally proposed that we tell the Malaysians that we will withdraw the claim to Sabah if it becomes an independent state. This, of course, the Malaysians will not like.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6880" data-line-end="6888">By all means we should keep Indonesia on our side because if Indonesia starts supporting the Muslim rebels we would really be in trouble.<br>
So since she is interested in playing mediator we should encourage her to do so.<br>
Ex-Vice Pres. Pelaez will go to Indonesia to confer with Minister [illegible].<br>
I noted the interest with which the generals and colonels listened to the documents involving Raschid Lucman and Ex- Sen. Domocao Alonto in the training of the insurgents in Malaysia and Sabah as well as the aid from Col. Kaddafi, Tungku Abdul Raman and Tun [illegible].<br>
Then the letter of Credit guaranteed by Col. Kaddafi, opened against a California bank, in favor of men of Larry Tractman.<br>
Today I spent working on the various economic areas, the Commission on Elections for the referendum next July, the public works program and the rice problem.<br>
The KBS station at Roxas Blvd. completely burned last night. They will have to lease the ABS-CBN premises.<br>
The National Defense Board met this noon at the Luna Hall in the Dept. of Foreign Affairs. I took advantage of the presence of Admiral Clarey, the CINCPAC to give them (he and Mrs. Taylor and son Christopher) souvenir.</li>

Returned from Talaga Bay at 6:00 PM. Rested up to 9:00 AM from 5:00 PM. Then water skied up to 2:00 PM.<br>
On the way back to Manila passed by Mariveles. Pilao (the low portion of the hills of Cochinos Point is a protection from the Southwest wind. So it could be used the Mariveles side) for waterskiing later in the year. We also passed by [illegible] Cove.<br>
I have just received copies of the papers of Raoul Velasco seeking political asylum in the U.S. They indicate the escapists’ and adventurer’s desire to involve the United States again in Philippine affairs –notwithstanding all that the CIA and the State Dept stand for — the murder of Ngo Dinh Diem, the abandonment of Taiwan, etc — and domination of the Philippines all over again. (I attach the papers)<br>
This represents for me the mentality of the Lopezes, Aranetas, Manglapus, etc who<br>

cannot understand the Maoists in the Philippines who would turn us to Chinese masters are not any worse than they.<br>
They have the same weakness of character that the Filipino has long been heir to — no integrity, no self-relaince.</p>

6th Inauguration of the PC Metrocom at Camp Crame. I explained the need of consulting with the people periodically and the country faces many historic decisions — when these decisions are made, there must be no doubt about the support by the people of such decisions.<br>
The Metrocom commander, Gen. Alfredo Montoya, I revealed, was one of those of the military (among them the major service commanders and intelligence) also was consulted on the need for the proclamation of martial law. And the plan of neutralizing the subversives in the Greater Manila area by arrest and detention was assigned to the Metrocom.<br>

There is need to reorient the policies of the military as well as the civil government.<br>
The Armed Forces has slipped back to its old policy of dividing its strike forces and being held to a stalemate by the rebels. This is true in the Sabak. From fighting in Cotabato, Basilan and Pata Island Sulu. As well as in Sorsogon.<br>
We have not been able to liquidate the areas of resistance over a period of months.<br>
We must give this priority, the prompt proper utilization of combat personnel and concentration of forces must be reinstated to its primary status.<br>
And the bureaucracy in the civil government is shocking. It must cut down the red tape, the keeping of files and documentation of routine action. More use of the telephone and direct conversation will save time and resources.<br>
The slow reaction on the rice crisis is an object lesson.</p>

Ex-Sen. Salonga has led about 12 men who want the referendum postponed for a month as a body of Concerned Citizens to supervise the referendum instead of the Comelec.<br>

I will sign the decree tomorrow.<br>
I have also approved the four-year development plan.<br>
We are trying all we can to have Pertamina Pres. Satowo help us in procurement of crude oil. He arrived by his Gulfstream jet on my invitation and I played golf with him.<br>

And Imelda was worried that the people may vote against me and my administration.<br>
This is the first time I have won a popular mandate without working for it. No campaigning. No speeches. No expenses. And no headaches.<br>
With this new popular mandate I can appoint a successor and a Legislative Advisory Council. I can move more forcefully in what could be controversial issues like the appointments to the Supreme Court and the Commissions of Audit and Civil Service.<br>

But Father Donalan told Imelda that in addition to this I have had luck….<br>
I admit that I have had phenomenal luck in time of war as well as peace.<br>
And there must be a Guiding Hand above who has forgiven me my sins, of which I have had more than my mortal share, and led me to my destiny.<br>
Because all the well-nigh impossible accomplishments have seemed to be natural and fore ordained. And into the role of supposed hero in battle, top scholar, President I seemed to have gracefully moved into without the awkwardness of pushiness and over anxiety.</p>

Romulo who attended the ASEAN minister’s conference saw Pres. Soeharto to deliver my letter wherein I pointedly accused Malaysia of training the rebels in the South and furnishing arms, equipment and funds to them.<br>
One thing disturbs me and that is that Pres. Soeharto seems to be convinced by Razak. He has said that “he considered the evidence of both parties of equal weight,” and the situation in Mindanao is “serious and deteriorating…” I have told him that we can handle the internal situation. We are concerned about war which we must prevent. I enclose the cable of Romulo and my answer.<br>
He has invited me to meet him in Monado instead of Balikpapan and on the 29-30 and not on the 25th.<br>
I intend to go there by yacht. Sec. Melchor went there by C-130 and suggests docking at Bitong, instead.<br>
I attach the letter of Pres. Soeharto which I received from Maj. Gen. Noli Jokjobranapalo -and my answer.<br>
Amb. Sullivan met me last Thursday May 9th and reported on his trip to Washington. I attach my notes.<br>
Apparently he cannot prmise any of the tactical missiles. But A-4 (Skyhawk) or F 5-A planes and radar for the south on credit (FMS).<br>
Sugar -1.5 million tons quota and reduction of the tariff on coconut oil and veneer.<br>

Our basic strategy with respect to Malaysia is to impress her with our credible defense posture and capability. Thus the announcement on Phil. Air Force Day of the need to increase our armed forces first by [illegible] then to 256,000. I did not announce that including the local police of about 100,000 and private security groups of 40,000 this would total 396,000 by the end of 1976.<br>

Stayed up the whole night up to 7:00 AVi because of the pain in my left foot. But I read. I finished the book The Man – the story of a negro becoming president of the U.S his impeachment and victory,<br>
The slept up to 12:30 AM when I was awakened by the kiss of Imelda who arrived from Tacloban (where it is still raining) with the children.<br>
Slept again after lunch, a shower and meeting with the doctors (Dr. Canto) from 2:00 PM to 4:30 PM.<br>
Then met the delegates to the Concon from the north. We spoke of their needs. And it looks like the parliamentary form of government and unicameralism will triumph.<br>
Also saw Sen. Pres. Puyat and Sec. Constancio Castañeda as well as Cong. Danding Cojuangco who is worried about the NPA’s in Tarlac.<br>
I attach an interesting letter of Guino de Vega.</p>

Office of the President<br>
of the Philippines<br>
Malacañang<br>
May 28, 1975<br>
The force of nationalism has always been underestimated by the great powers. This they did again in Indo China –specially the United States.<br>
Americans are still asking the question as “to why our (American) Vietnamese did not fight as well as the Vietnamese of the enemy (Hanoi or Viet Cong).”<br>
Simply because the Americans can never accept the fact that their Vietnamese looked like American puppets while the Viet Minh and Vietcong, no matter how much aid Russia and China gave them, succeeded in giving the impression that they were nationalist fighter — revolutionaries and not reactionaries.<br>
Fighting for country as against the foreign invader, fighting for the poor as against the rich, this has always been a great motivating force.<br>
This is one reason, the American bases have to go before I and my administration look like the puppets of the Americans and lose the support of a nationalistic people and region.<br>
This is one reason we have to go to Peking and normalize relations with China.<br>
Then later to Moscow to normalize relations with Russia.<br>
So we will disengage from the deathly embrace of the Americans without causing hostility and bringing about retaliation. For they can retaliate if they want to. —<br>
Most of the incoming investments and technology are American. So are most of the loans specially from the World Bank and the Export-Import Bank. Our foreign trade is mostly with the Americans. We must change the pattern in all these. And we are slowly doing so.</p>

Foreign magazines are trying to romanticize the Moro National Liberation Front, to the Phil. Govts prejudice.<br>
I attach the latest copy of the Far Eastern Economic Review which publishes an alleged interview with Abdul Khayr Alonto, former Vice Mayor of Marawi City, son of ex Gov Madki Alonto, my fraternity brother, who was arrested after the Marawi uprising in 1973 (October) and whom I ordered released at the instance of then Gov. Alonto Lucman, the aunt, married to former Cong. Raschid Lucman.<br>
I also attach the Chief of Staff’s report (Gen. Romeo Espino) on the sweep that I ordered in Jolo, and Cotabato at the site where the rebels claim strength.<br>
I have ordered the procurement of short-range surveillance radar sets (CN/PPS-5) from Airborne Instruments Fab.[illegible] , Deer Park New York 11729. I attach the brochure on the instrument.</p>

Went to Sierra Lakes (Caliraya) yesterday for a day of skiing. Slashed my right thigh with the tow rope grip while turning left. The Dutch and Australian champions demonstrated the jump, tracking and slalom. Amazing, skiing on one foot (barefoot) and turning.<br>
The Jeddah meeting of the Islamic Conference started today. I have sent the delegation of Gov. Datumanong, Gov. Lao and Com. Abubakar to convey the resolution of the Muslim leaders in Zamboanga that they cannot accept the supposed agenda for the meeting of the MNLF with the Phil. government.<br>
We are trying to obtain the open support of the Indonesians, Malaysia and Pakistan in the conference by playing their inherent fear of Arab intervention in their own internal affairs.<br>

of setting down the form of government in Southern Philippines is intervention in our internal affairs. The entire proposed agenda smacks of dictation and humiliation. So the Muslim leaders have rightly rejected the agenda.<br>
However, I believe it is Libya who is leading the interventionists above. The others seem to be merely following Libya’s lead.<br>
In the meantime I have ordered the pressure to be kept on the rebels on all fronts. The rebels have suffered heavily from the fighting.<br>
I attach the Field Inspection Report of the Chief of Staff.<br>
In the meantime there is no report about the investigation by Usec Ingles of the Primitivo Mijares and Jack Anderson column [illegible].<br>

The prices of our exports are slowly improving — especially sugar which is now 18 cents a pound FOB.<br>
We have sold some (50,000 tons) at 25 cents per pound refined or 20 cents raw or centrifugal to Shiek Abdallah Darcuish Fakroh but he has not opened the Letter of Credit.<br>
And we sold futures (end of September up to one year thereafter) at 18 cents a pound to Falsam which is probably the broker for Westzucker of Germany. They have up to Thursday to put in the advance for the first 100,000 of $118,000 in cash deposit.<br>
On the July 6, 1975 South China Morning Post appears the story, “India takes leaf out of Marcos’ book.” Flattering.</p>

Ex-Pres. Macapagal has just announced tonight that he is seeking asylum in the U.S. Embassy.<br>
Poor man. He must be a pitiful sight. A has-been trying hard to be noticed and to play Don Quixote de la Mancha!<br>
If Ambassador Sullivan wrote the script, they deserve each other.<br>
Is this why Amb. Sullivan left Manila for Washington so early last week when the military negotiations start April 12th.<br>
The book written by Ex-Pres. Macapagal entitled “Democracy in the Philippines” is recast of the minority position of some lawyers and justices in the plebiscite and martial law cases started by Aquino no.”<br>
Worse things have been said by Tañada, Diokno, Aquino, Salonga and [illegible].<br>
We will ignore the incident ——–<br>
I have asked USec Collantes to tell the American chargé d’affaires that there is a warrant of arrest or threat against Ex Pres. Macapagal and we will help him go whenever he wants to go –even to the U.S.<br>
The chargé told Gen. Ver and USec Collantes that “Political asylum is out.” They must be embarrassed by the Macapagal “escape” to their premises.<br>

We are the first member to ratify the two documents.<br>
I also issued instructions to Sec. Romulo on his trip to the U.S. on the negotiations on the military agreements: “Explain [to] Pres. Ford [illegible] Kissinger that we intend to take an active part in the Third World conferences [illegible] for a new world economic order; that we can be a bridge between the U.S. and the developing countries because we represent the moderates with a concrete plan to bring about a rapprochement; But we cannot act as a [illegible] bridge if we are not credible as a free agent. So we have to wipe out the vestiges of the pre-Vietnam commitments. The Foreign Secretary and Minister of North Vietnam succesfully kept us out of the conference of Neutral States last year.<br>

I deliberately cut my Bataan Day Dambana Ng Kagitingan to the simplest and starkest statements. I attach the speech. the corrected manuscript is not what I delivered. Most of the insert I did not deliver. Too prolix for such an audience. Not good<br>
The hijacked PAL BAC-111 is still in Bangkok with a damaged hydraulic system and tire. They have been offered a commercial airline trip to Cairo which they have initially refused.<br>
I have, by telephone, authorizedAmbassador Manuel Yan in Bangkok to [illegible] a conditional pardon</p>

<strong>MALACAÑAN PALACE</strong><br>

April 1, 1977<br>
Life after Life —<br>
The phenomenon of 12 people declared clinically dead and returned to life.<br>
Hair-raising as these experiences coincide with mine in August of 1974 when I was ill of black-water fever in the Philippine General Hospital.<br>
As I explained to the boys some time ago, the floating away from the body seemed to me then a part of my delirium but when I recounted what I saw floating above my body and everyone else, the priest coming to give me extreme unction, the doctor (Dr. Agerico B.M. Sison) saying I was gone, the people around me trying to revive me, etc., it was uncanny that it coincided with what actually happened.<br>
Father Cruz keeps repeating that the North Vietnamese won the war with only rifles and rockets against the greatest military power in the world because of their national spirit.<br>
Partly true. It is also true that the South Vietnamese were not equally resolved and motivated because they were not convinced that they were fighting for their country since the Americans loomed large as the principal protagonist and interested party. The South Vietnamese were not fighting for their country. Desertions were high.<br>
Paradoxically, neither were the Americans (both the leaders and followers) convinced of the justice of their cause. Desertions were equally high. And the councils of government were divided. The media were against the war.<br>
So the United States held back its power. It was fighting with one hand tied behind –voluntarily.<br>

Some of our own leaders have misgivings about calling an election both for local leaders and the Interim Batasan Pambansa.<br>
But I believe it is time to do so. Next year may be economically worse for the world and the Philippines with it.<br>
[illegible] presidential mandate this December after a good harvest. And the legislative elections next April or May during good weather.<br>

Jose Maria Sison was captured at <s>4:00</s> 2:45 AM today at an Underground House , San Fernando, La Union (south of it near the [illegible] the new disco neighborhood).The team leader was Col. Ismael Rodrigo of [illegible] under the supervision of Lt. Col. Aguirre from PC and Zone P –[illegible] not know about it. Purely intelligence, it seems.<br>
We are keeping him at PSC [illegible] for interrogation and follow-up operations. [illegible] volume of documents and grenades [illegible] operations were captured but apparently [illegible] escaped.<br>
Saw him at 10:30 AM at the PSC social hall as he had asked not to be shot when he was captured because he had something to tell the President.<br>
Still confident. Talkative. He admitted he had avoided being shot by shouting he would talk to the President.<br>
Suggested I could use him.<br>
He admitted contact between the CPP and the MNLF. Bragged that in two years they would have succeeded as there were three forces against me –the MNLF, the CPP and the CIA.<br>
I told him he was like Ninoy Aquino –a man who lives in a world created by his own words, a braggart and a loud mouth.<br>
And whe he protested that there [illegible] he could be used I told him [illegible] a temporary [illegible] and that violent revolution was not [illegible].<br>
We had two hours [illegible] down and [illegible] in 1965.<br>
I enclose the reports.<br>
Conversation with Sison.<br>

I have decided to add interest to the referendum campaign by picking Ex-Pres. Macapagal as the best strawman and issuing an answer to his charges before the Manila Lion’s Club under Cesar Lucero on the MNLF having been brought about by the proclamation of martial law, martial law lifting and my resigning as president and leaving the country so that there would be free elections.<br>

The William Buckley column on my war activities has revived some of the trauma I felt in the war.<br>
And so I ended my personal war without any sense of victory but weighed down by the tears that could not flow.<br>
My hope was that I could heal the scars of my spirit, more galling than those of my body.<br>
My right abdominal muscles were cut through never to grow back and my left knee was mangled.<br>
But the injury of my soul was deeper and despairing.<br>

My assessment is that we need martial law to bring about a successful termination of the secessionist movement of the MLF.<br>
If martial law is now lifted even partially, the MNLF will not be under any pressure to negotiate a settlement.<br>
Specially now that Col. Khaddafi has sent word as of the 17th that he wants the negotiations resumed.<br>
And we cannot trust him unless we negotiate from a position of strength.<br>

I had sought to protect the sacredness and preciousness of my memories of the war with the sanctity of silence. So I had refused to talk or write about them except in an indirect way when forced to as when I offered my medals to the dead for I believed all such medals belonged to them.<br>
But the sanctity of silence has been broken by the pettiness and cynicism that overwhelms the contemporary world. And the small souls whose vicarious achievement is to insult and offend the mighty and the achievers have succeeded in trivializing the most solemn and honorable of deeds and intentions. Their pettiness has besmirched with the foul attention the honorable service of all who have received medals and citations in the last World War. They have not excluded me. But instead have made me their special target as the most visible of those who offered blood, honor and life to our people.<br>
So I must fight the battles of Bataan all over again. We must walk our Death March in the hot April sun once again. The Calvary of the USAFFE must again be told.<br>
For we bleed and die again. This time in the hands of men who claim to be our countrymen.<br>
