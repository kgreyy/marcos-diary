January 2, 1970<br>
Mrs. Agnew left this morning to join VP Agnew at Taipeh. Meldy had breakfast with her – 7:30 – she was not awake so she (Meldy) waited for 8:30 AM.<br>
Last Dec. 29, 1969 when I was playing golf two sausage twin-rotor navy (U.S.) helicopters for VP Agnew landed at the golf course and obstructed the whole fairway. When we asked that they move a little to the side so we could play through they did not bother but said we could go right ahead and hit the helicopters with our balls. Typical younger generation comment on this was Imee’s “Yabang na manga Cano –”.<br>
Ordered protection for the nine teachers of Batanes testifying about terrorism, a public hearing on the Nawasa rates hike, Com. Vera (BIR) to study a year’s amnesty for untaxed incomes voluntarily disclosed. In Ising’s party I asked Charlie Ledesma, President of the Sugar Planters to bring the planters to the palace on the 14th so I could convince them to pay the sacadas the minimum wage. Also ordered Gen. Yan to implement my original order to retrain the special forces and use them in Central Luzon as a unit.<br>
The children and Meldy had a crying bee on their not attending the Ising party (after lunch) at the dining table ending in our bedroom where we had a frank grievance session, by the way –<br>

Some people asked me why I have given away my earthly possessions. I invariably answered that I did not need them but that the people did.<br>
But I have been asking myself why has the world become so vile, so materialistic, so dirty. All is pragmatism, selfish and unedifying.  Why is there no more tenderness – all sex? Why is there no more charity – all malice? Even the clergy has become self-centered. They do not sacrifice for sacrifice’ sake, but for self-glorification like the seven bishops who had their appeal to me published in the front pages of the metropolitan dailies. If their motivation was sincere change, they could have come to me first – but they sought publicity first. The worst part is their premises were all false, I hope, from ignorance not malice.<br>
During the war in some critical phase of a battle I always asked myself what could I do which others dare not do and which would change the tide of battle.<br>
Now after the 1965 elections I kept asking myself this – until I decided that giving my properties to the people was the answer.<br>
This would be exemplary. No one else dares to do it.<br>
It will change the tide of the times.<br>
Instead of pragmatism – compassion.<br>
Instead of words – deeds.<br>
Instead of self – the nation &amp; humanity.<br>
And I gather this has been the effect in the capitals of the world.<br>
Satisfying but I must exert effort so I am not myself dragged into self-glorification. I remember after the war I concealed everything about my medals. I wish I could do a similar anonymity now.<br>
Finalizing the foundation papers. Accounting more difficult than I thought.<br>
Princess Tarhata Kiram and her husband gave me a memo tonight on their alleged mistreatment by the Phil. Govt. and their wish to deal directly and not thru the Phil. Govt. – as always they also asked for pocket money.<br>
Birthday party in San Juan (Ortega) of Alita Romualdez Martel who is now _______? The Romualdezes who are all on the substantial side all had an electrocardiograph. Poor Dits had a tough time.<br>
Boni Serrano just died from a heart attack. Have to go and see his body in Camp Crame chapel tomorrow.<br>
Had Dr. Chamberlain to check me – all well. My blood pressure after golf – 112/80.  7:00 PM Dr. Chamberlain has been called to attend to Iñing Lopez comatose in a hotel lobby in Tokyo &amp; again in Manila from bypoglycomia (no sugar in the blood). Bad Luck!! He is recovering.<br>
Tomorrow, the politburo prisoners are released. Have ordered that they be placed under surveillance. The Peking-trained kids have organized a New People’s Army in Tarlac under Arthur Garcia.<br>
Am collecting the reactions to my disposal of all my possessions to the people.<br>
Some are sanctimonious, supercilious, patronizing (Imee loves to repeat these newly discovered words) frauds.<br>
I fear for our country. There is not one among the younger generation whom we can build up as President. Among the Nacionalistas, Puyat and Lopez are too old, Tolentino has a background of promiscuity, Diokno is self-centered and lacks humility. Among the Liberals Roxas is a weakling, Aquino is a congenital liar, a braggart and a compulsive chatterbox, Magsaysay is brainless, Salonga is petty, pompous, sanctimonious fraud.<br>

Ex-Pres. Macapagal who is visiting in Singapore says that he is shocked by the news that there is supposed to be a secret agreement for the Sabah claim to be relinquished by the Philippines after the resumption of diplomatic relations.<br>
There is no such agreement. I used Mr. Moon Park and Mr. Chang Ming Thieu as emissaries to Prime Minister Tungku Abdul Rahman and Deputy Prime Minister Tun Abdul Ragak so that they would agree to the resumption of diplomatic relations. The Tungku had insisted on such relinquishment of the claim and a recognition formally of the sovereignty of Malaysia over Sabah, but I refused and they formally agreed that after diplomatic relations our two peoples should get used to each other travelling in our respective countries before we spoke of these matters. The Filipinos should now go to Sabah and invest there.<br>
VP Agnew in Thailand and Taipeh has said that I asked him whether America was slowly withdrawing from Asia and he had answered in the negative. I asked Pres. Nixon the same thing. He was more vague, although when he reached the U.S. he did say what Agnew is saying now.<br>
What I want to know is what bases they are going to keep in Asia and what troops where, and under what arrangements<br>
Agnew is quoted as saying he had told me that he had made me understand and that he told me that, of course, the number and location would change with the need.<br>
He told me nothing of the kind.<br>
On the last day of his stay here, Jan. 1st, when I talked to him about the U.S. helping us on our present balance of payments problem, he was evasive. I did not press the point.<br>
Either he has no power to commit the U.S. or he is still feeling his way around.<br>
During the conference at 11:30 AM if Dec. 31st when I met all the special envoys of 44 governments who attended my inauguration, the only matter on which there was some vestige of promise of help was on studies of typhoons and their control. Amb. Byroade is supposed to follow this up.<br>
I impressed on VP Agnew that we in Asia could not make any plans on our security if we did not know their plans but that however even in such state of ignorance we in the Philippines are moving to prepare to defend ourselves on our own.<br>
He invited me to come to the U.S. after September 1970 – preferably not while the other heads of state are in the U.S. on the UN anniversary. I made no commitment on the exact date but did promise to go.<br>
Pres. Nixon and VP Agnew strike me as very evasive about helping the Philippines now although they are supporting us in the IMF and IBRD in our efforts to get dollar loans.<br>
I am skeptical about the wisdom of a trip to the U.S.<br>
I have told Sec. Romulo repeatedly that there should be no further talks of the U.S. military bases in the Phil and our wish to remove them as we will use this as the “ultimate weapon” in the trading that may be needed to obtain recognition of our special preferences in the American market. For if our quota on sugar is not extended by the Sugar Act’s extension this year or by treaty in the replacement of the Laurel-Langley agreement, then the sugar industry is wrecked and our economy may be disastrously affected.<br>
So I have told VP Agnew that before the formal negotiations on trade and security start we should have an understanding as to what terms such negotiations would arrive at. I said that I would like Amb. Byroade to be able to sit down with me on this.<br>
Rod Reyes, editor of the <em>Manila Chronicle</em>, has just told Kits Tatad that they are planning to serialize the libelous book of Chit Navarro on Imelda.<br>
We have to watch the Lopezes and Montelibano. They are still sore for my veto of their franchise to operate a telephone and telecommunications company anywhere in the Philippines and the NuVue – a cable television company that would select programs from any of the television companies (without permission from the latter) to be flashed to their subscribers by cable. Both were illegal and unconstitutional but they took offense at the veto.<br>
They are the worst oligarchs in the country.<br>
I must stop them from using the government for their own purposes.<br>
Piding Montelibano is working on the reclamation project of Republic Real Estate – pending adjudication in the courts.<br>
Iñing Lopez strongly urged that I appoint Piding as Secretary of Finance, as if the position were vacant. This was a repetition of the recommendation in 1965.<br>
Peace and order must be immediately attended to.<br>
I must work out the programs for exports and tourism.<br>
Then I must appoint the replacement of Gov. Calalang as Governor of the Central Bank. The IMF consultative group arrives in Jan. 10th.<br>
There are more than 100 CFI vacancies, 7 Court of Appeals, one in the Supreme Court and another vacancy coming up in February.<br>
The Armed Forces has too many hold-overs who should be retired.<br>
We must change the strategy in Central Luzon against the Huks. We must restudy the use of civilians either as agents or informers.<br>
There are three basic problems that I am personally attending to:</p>

VP Lopez promised to stop that libelous book about Imelda. I told him Chit Navarro Pedrosa was saying that the Lopezes had directed her to write the book. (Perhaps Iñing but not Nanding who is naïve.) She (Chit Navarro Pedrosa) tried to blackmail us by demanding P500,000 and a reparations vessel plus the return of P200,000 from Cesar Lanuza allegedly extorted during his Reparations Mission days.<br>

Monching Durano, Uging Navarro, Floring Crisologo, Ali Dimpaporo and Joe Alberto came to see me as they want to change Laurel as speaker of the House. He has been criticizing me again and so has his brother, Doy Laurel who wants to run for President in 1973.<br>
I have given permission for them and their groups which would be controlling, not to attend the caucuses called by Speaker Laurel.<br>
However, we would have more problems if Laurel is deposed as speaker. But we will keep him after we have clarified the position they (he and his Capo) have taken on the apparently socialist and communist policies they are pronouncing under the guise of nationalism and the unjustified criticisms of his brother.<br>
The same is true in the Senate. Sen. Jose Roy, President Pro-Tempore seeks the presidency. In the coming constitutional convention we must make the VP the presiding officer of the Senate if the bicameral system is retained.<br>

Your letter reads like a menu. And I am beginning to feel like a kid looking into a candy shop from the outside. I can’t say the skirts are the causes of my unhealthy state but if they are, they surely are “giving me the shivers.”<br>

Lifted the limitation of flights of foreign carriers from Japan for one year – but Pan Am must spend $1 million to promote the route and build its own terminal.<br>
No more need for transit visas.<br>
Development of the Manila Tourist belt (Central Bank P200,000), police security for tourists including certification of taxicab companies, Tagaytay, Corregidor, Bataan, Pagsanjan – Navy hydrofoil to Corregidor &amp; Bataan run.<br>
Will ask the tourist &amp; business community to talk to the publishers to tone down on crime.<br>

Breakfast with Speaker Laurel, Speaker Pro Temp Jose Aldeguer and Maj. Floor Leader Marcelino Veloso. Told him of the drift towards the left and the fear of political leaders, businessmen and the military that we are not taking steps to prevent it but are instead encouraging it. He has agreed to remove Emmanuel Yap, head of Cepo and his next in rank Lichauco.<br>
Then met with Former Speaker Villareal and Com on Appro Chairman Jose Alberto who agreed that we call a Nacionalista House Members Caucus Tuesday, Jan. 13th 10:00 AM at Pangarap. I intend to interview the different blocs and see who is supported by the majority.<br>
But we must not allow the Nacionalista Party to split up on this rivalries. We must keep our old cohesion. So I also intend to call Pres. Pro Temp Jose Roy, rival of Pres Puyat for the Presidency of the Senate.<br>
A demonstration of Batanes students – about 500 asked for arrest of those still terrorizing would-be witnesses. They claim PC helpless. So I have ordered the NBI deputy chief, Ponciano Fernando to personally go with 12 PC men who are from Batanes, to obtain evidence against, identify, arrest and prosecute all the alleged terrorists. I challenged the young men and women to fight for their rights by testifying and convincing their relatives, friends and fellow Batanenses to testify.<br>
I am happy that my speech before the Rotary yesterday noon on Open Skies for one year and lifting of the suspension of loans for mining and new export oriented industries has been taken well.<br>
I can feel the confidence surging back to our people. Standard remark was: “We did not know this was being done. We are glad he is President.” Soft-soap but gratifying.<br>
Earl Mazo, Nixon’s biographer, has just interviewed me and he says Imelda and I are so high above the newspapers and the crowd now that we should not be concerned what the papers print because if it is bad, the people will not believe it anyway.<br>
Two questions have come up in his interview:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="213" data-line-end="214">Are the U.S. military bases in the Philippines a deterrent or a magnet to bombing and/or nuclear attack. (The Recto &amp; Laurel position is that they are mere magnets not deterrents and are not only useless but prejudicial to Philippine national interest.) I personally believe that now with the present nuclear capability of Red China and the ABM buildup of the U.S., we need the bases for the defense of the Phil. If China had not developed its nuclear capability we would not need them. Pres. Nixon explained to me last March when Imelda and I attended the Eisenhower memorial services in Washington D.C. how the U.S. would use the ABM (Anti-Ballistic Missile) to counter-act any nuclear threat from Red China.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="214" data-line-end="216">What will happen to our economy, specially the sugar industry if the IS does not extend our special preferences. (Of course the sugar industry would collapse because special preferences or the quota given us in the American market allows us to sell our sugar at the favored price of 7 cents a pound as against 3 cents a pound in the world market. And our cost of production is from 3 to 4 cents a pound. Our dollar earnings from sugar alone is $160 million out of a total dollar earnings of $1.5 billion.)<br>

I have enclosed the study of the nullification of the congressional elections in Batanes so I can call a special election but the Comelec (Ferrer, Miraflor and Patajo) says they think there is a hiatus in the law and that their power to nullify is in grave doubt. So I have suggested that they pass a resolution that no one has been elected because in the five towns only in one (the capital of Basco) has there been peaceful and free elections. The Speaker of the House would then be compelled to certify to a vacancy in Batanes. Then I would call a special election.<br>
Have ordered that Commodore Cabal, the commander of the South West Command, and who is from Batanes, — go to Batanes with a squad of marines to give protection to the people there.<br>
The groups supporting Ex-Speaker Villareal for speakership have asked me to remain neutral in the speakership fight and will take this stand in the caucus next Tuesday. The reasons they (Yñiguez who has withdrawn at my promptings, Niling Espinosa, Joe Alberto, Floring Crisologo) give for opposing Laurel is that Banjo Laurel, mayor of Tanauan and son of the Speaker, has been withdrawing funds from the House, signed by Eucinas, chairman of the Committee on accounts and monopolizes all contracts of the House.<br>
Have ordered a tariff and tax free zone to be established in the Nayon Pilipino at MIA; the release of P2.2 million for the new finger terminal at MIA and the preparation of the runway for the Jumbo Jets. We need to add two inches on the surface. Conferred with Sec. Leo Virata, CAA Administrator Federico Ablan and MIA Airport Manager Luis Tabuena.<br>
Boni reports a new assassination plot by the same group masterminded by Terry Adevoso. Malacañang is under sector Noth Manila leadership of which was offered to Joe Maristela, former CIS head, now our informant.<br>
Everybody is suggesting that Imelda take over the efforts at improving tourism. 800,000 to one million tourists visit Hongkong yearly, 400,000 to Bangkok – but only 120,000 to Manila.<br>
So I have asked that all airlines, new and old, be allowed to land in the Philippines without limit at least for one year – the year of Expo-70. We should known then how this will affect our domestic airlines. My feeling is this will build up so much traffic that they will have their share of the increase.<br>
The Chief of Police of Angeles City (a Sumanlan) and a relative of Gov. Nepomuceno, more accurately Mrs. Nepomuceno (who is a Sumanlan) has just been killed. The PC surmise that a man of Mayor Suarez did it as Nepomuceno is feuding with Commander Sumulong, who is in partnership with Mayor Suarez. Nepomuceno is in turn in partnership with Commander Dante.<br>
So I will let them finish off each other in the meantime. But we have got to get in and finish all of them before they wreck the entire government.<br>
I feel, however, that the Barrio Home Defense force of 5 or ten men per barrio is the answer to the Huk movement.<br>

Our national security –<br>
Our principal problem is still internal subversion not foreign aggression. We are protected by the oceans from the latter. But more than this we are protected by the following set of circumstances.</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="244" data-line-end="245">Red China’s present internal problems of development which occupies her energies, leaders and resources.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="245" data-line-end="246">The incipient quarrel between Red China and Russia.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="246" data-line-end="247">Japan’s present allergy to the suggestion to rearm.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="247" data-line-end="263">The presence of the U.S. in Asia.<br>
The first three circumstances may not be there after a decade. The only deterrent would be the presence of the U.S. through bases in South Korea, South Vietnam, Thailand, southern Japan and the Philippines. This was what Ambassador Byroade must have been referring to in his Rotary Speech last November after the elections.<br>
The ideal situation would be if the U.S. maintains its presence with its nuclear umbrella in Asia, without the indignity of American bases in the Philippines.<br>
In the meantime the American military bases, if they have to stay, must be governed by agreements that should be updated to the level of other countries’ treaties on the same subject – like that of Spain and Thailand.<br>
And now as in the years to come, the Philippines must watch the balance of power in Asia. If Red China has no counterpoise, it may find the time to establish its dream of Asian hegemony. The counterpoise could be Russia which is trying hard to become an Asian power, and Japan which will ultimately rearm.<br>
The ideal is Russia and Red China not settling their quarrel and Red China and Japan not being too friendly to each other.<br>
Whatever the international situation is, we must be prepared to defend our country alone. The classic defenses on the air, the sea and on the beaches must be augmented with the home defense concept of the guerilla which will make any attack (external or internal) of a massive nature too costly to be considered lightly by a potential aggressor.<br>
I must establish communications in the barrios covered by the Barrio Home Defense Force. Sitio San Juan, Barrio Moriones, Tarlac, Tarlac, was raided yesterday morning (after midnight) by possibly Huks out to terrorize the Barrio Home Defense Forces there which fought back for 20 minutes. If there had been an alarm system, helicopters could have brought succor.  Flashlight battery run and cheap and simple – buzzer coded system.<br>
One woman was killed and five men wounded.<br>
Two helicopters helped capture in Barrio Patling, Capas, Tarlac, Huk Commander Rody Dizon alias Rody and four companions. Dizon was still carrying the Armalite of S/St. Nestor M. Mariano of the 511 PC Ranger Company.  The name of Mariano was still on the butt of the Armalite.<br>
We will use the helicopters more and more. One should be based at II PC Zone HQ. and three at Basa Airfield on alert.<br>
According to the men in the field, the Huks are in dreadful fear of the helicopters.<br>
Everybody in the city speaks of the “monkees” when they were ordered disbanded a long time ago.<br>
On foreign exchange earnings, we can offer the products of our parks, forest resources and even the ores to be mined from our mineral reserves with govt. doing the work – provided the buyers now advance a few hundred million dollars. Am looking into this possibility.<br>
As well as selling our old coins and minting new ones – of gold.<br>

The Villareal group has obtained 67 signatures. Went to see the body of Mayor “Banjo” Laurel who died in a helicopter crash at Pi, Cam. Sur the other night. Their heli went out of gas, landed, refueled with ordinary gasoline, took off at night and crashed.<br>
If I do not help Pepito Laurel, he will lose the speakership fight.<br>
Have postponed the caucus to Wednesday after Banjo’s funeral.<br>
Will visit Iñing Lopez at the Meralco Hosp. tomorrow, at the suggestion of the VP, Nanding &amp; Jose Aldeguer.<br>
Received six vessels from the U.S. requested by Amb. Byroade, three LSTs, one tugboat and two LCVPs, this morning at Navy headquarters, then a courtesy call from Mr. Roy Mason, head of the Board of Trade of England, then the City boy and girl officials, Ramon Jacinto and Sen. Aytona on the requirements of ISMI which was one of the big contributors in the last campaign.<br>
Am now completing the files including expenses and contributions.<br>

Awarded the Rizal Pro Patria to Don Vicente Madrigal.<br>
Saw Iñing Lopez in the Meralco Hospital. Had lunch with him. Had sashimi and tempura as well as mizuno and Japanese melon. He is disgustingly healthy.<br>
Worked the whole afternoon on counter-insurgency, the emergency plan and the Barrio Home Defense Force.<br>
A new confirmed report of a plot to assassinate both me and the Vice President has just been reported by Boni and confirmed by Joe Maristela. The military group is headed by Terry Adevoso – the political group is still being checked.<br>
Apparently the plans of the Liberal paralleled those of the communists. They will await the results of my efforts to improve the economic situation then if I fail, they will take advantage of this by assassination.<br>
Well, we must not fail!!<br>
And I must check the participation of Pres. Puyat of the Senate and Speaker Laurel of the House.<br>
Ralph Nubla reported tonight that Congressman Yap of Tarlac, right-hand man of Sen. Ninoy Aquino, has said that they will give me six months – then they will strike. We must clarify all these plans.<br>
Imelda has a mass in the right breast and worries us because the doctors say that while there has been no change, an operation to remove it and to find out if it is malignant may be necessary.<br>
I am suffering from pain in the right groin after golf. I hope it is not hernia. I see the doctor tomorrow.<br>
And we were on a project to have another baby, a boy if possible. Massive injections of hormones for Imelda is necessary if we are to have a baby and this is not good for her growth in the breast which might develop into something serious with these hormones.<br>

Have told the congressmen we should keep Laurel as speaker in the whole morning and afternoon caucus. All the members of the Junta were for Laurel after I told them I was. But the Junta and I, first, had to announce for the consumption of the public that we could not intervene in purely internal matters of the House, unless the House members themselves asked us to personally intervene.<br>
After this, I called a conference of Cong. Ramon Durano, Nicanor Yñiguez, Ali Dimaporo, Ugung Navarro, Joe Alberto, Maling Espinosa, and Floring Crisologo to tell them that inasmuch as they are the leaders of Ex-Speaker Villareal, it was their duty to inform him of my decision and that the most ideal situation would be for Villareal to withdraw. Then I asked Villareal and Laurel to come into the conference room and notified each in turn of my efforts to prevent an open fight.<br>
A committee of six, three from Laurel’s side (Maj. Floor Leader Veloso, Asst. Floor Leader Mercado and Chiongbian), then three on Villareal’s side (Yñiguez, Alberto and Ali Dimaporo) was organized to proposed amendments to the rules of the House.<br>
Because of the ramifications of the Adevoso plot, I must include Johnny Ponce Enrile in the counter-planning – and perhaps J-2, Col. Fidel Ramos and the NBI. Played golf at Pangarap with the Malacañang reporters. Pain in the groin has disappeared. The doctors, Dr. Yap and P. Marcos think it was just a muscle sprain.<br>
But Imelda gets operated on at Veterans Memorial Hospital 6:00 AM on the 16th and will sleep at the hospital tomorrow.<br>

The newspapers headlined (specially Manila Times) the resignation of Nolan from the Sugar Quota Adm. and Sugar Institute. I have asked him to stay but today I have had to designate Jose Unson the Asst. Sugar Quota Adm. to replace him.<br>
This may precipitate a break with the Montelibanos and the Lopezes who, I am sure, are behind it.<br>
I hope Ex Sec. Alfredo Montelibano resigns from the RCA so I can appoint Bong Tanco.<br>
I write this on the evening of the 16th because last night after the birthday party of Hilda Ysmael, we slept at the Veterans Memorial Hospital so that Meldy may be operated on at 6:00 AM.<br>
Manila is talking about the sugar bloc blackmailing me into supporting Laurel for Speaker with the editorials of the Chronicle, the resignation of Nolan, the expected resignation of Montelibano and other signs.<br>
What they do not know is that Iñing Lopez when I saw him on the 13th at the Meralco Hospital insisted on the appointment of Montelibano as Secretary of Finance on the ground that there was need for a new face in the Finance Dept. I am sure this is because Danding Romualdez has refused to be their tool. Anyway I told him that if Danding Romualdez should be changed this would be an admission of the failure of the monetary policies which I am not ready to do because I approved of them. Although the state of our balance of payments was never revealed to me until June 1969 when it was impossible to do anything as any retrenchment and curtailment of imports and government expenditure would have caused a skyrocketing of process during the political campaign. This would have been a disaster.<br>
But as soon as my reelection was assured, I ordered all the necessary steps to be taken like the curtailment of imports and the cutting of government expenditures; all public works releases have been suspended, all casuals terminated, loans and guarantees by the government financing institutions stopped. Prices went up and I had to call the retailers, dealers and importers to maintain the old level of prices. We sent a mission to the U.S. and Europe to obtain new loans and restructure our short-term loans.<br>
Ting Roxas bungled the mission. According to Iñing Lopez, Maurice, the President of the German National Bank, Ting Roxas panicked everybody in Germany into believing that the Philippines was in chaos. And they came to the Philippines to see for themselves. To their surprise they discover us still operating as a democracy.<br>
Curse upon these theoretical economists!<br>

Meldy’s cyst in the right breast has been removed and found benign –as the report says the mass is a fibrocystic disease.<br>
When Inday (Dr. Paciencia Dicena) brought out the specimen, I was shocked at the size. It was about three inches by eight inches and a quarter of an inch thick. Dr. Pantangco and Ferriol were the pathologist. Dr. Pacifico Yap assisted by Dr. Uy performed the operation. Dr. Quentin Gosieg was the anesthesiologist assisted by Inday. Present were the heart specialists, Dr. Juanita Zagala and Dr. Pedro Cruz.<br>
We slept at the hospital last night at about 11:30 and woke uo at 5:00 AM when she was injected with some sedatives. Operation started at about 615 frozen section after 15 minutes and finished (sutured) at about 7.00 PM. A little depression was left at the site but the opening was only about three inches long.<br>
Reinstated my appointments for the day and met with the different chambers of commerce who have a letter offering cooperation, the Provincial Press Federation, Bishop Gaviola and Mr. Watanabe, the President of the Asian Development Bank.<br>
The whole city is still talking about the supposed rift between the sugar bloc and me. Yesterday Bobby Benedicto wnt to see Peding Montelibano. Called me up by telephone and I talked to Peding who was ill with influenza and he promised to come and see me at the Palace on Monday.<br>
We were all agreed that the cyst of Meldy was benign as it had not changed in size for the last two years and in fact has actually reduced in size. But she was beginning to contaminate  everyone with her tension including me.<br>
Meldy is resting well and ate Chinese lugaw from Ralph tonight. Bongbong kept us in stitches with stories of his first dance and the children’s parties he has attended.<br>
Horrors, Mother says she will be 77 next month and feels like 20 after Dr.  Meliavo and Switzerland. What a lot of these people in this room would give to feel like 20, specially Zita Feliciano who is trying to peep into my diary.<br>
All these women around here, I bet are all wondering if they have lumps in their breasts.<br>
Yesterday there was a demonstration of students from the Central University, Phil. Normal School and Phil. College of Arts and Trades for the release of P65 million and the appointment of their own choice of President for the Central University.<br>
Tonight Ignacio Lacsina led a thousand demonstrators in what Gen. Raval says is a month-long demonstration against the administration and the various govt. agencies like the PC, against alleged partisanship of the PC for the Northern Motors in the strike there. Ordered an investigation.<br>
Ordered Gen. Raval to follow-up of the plan I directed to set up alarm systems in the barrios under the BHDF.<br>

Manila Times and even the Bulletin are trying to promote a fight between me and the Media. Manila Times headlined the Nolan resignation, actually editorializing in that story.<br>
Then, yesterday, the Bulletin carried the front page story of me keeping on with attacks on the press quoting my statement or speech read by VP Lopez in the Bureau of Plant Industry inauguration that “notwithstanding the critics, we have moved forward”. This was interpreted, I suppose, to mean that the press are critics or the only critics and should not be referred to with the slightest hint of derision.<br>
My relations with the press in general, with the exception of the Malacañang boys has soured since the inaugural speech.<br>
They can dish it out but cannot take it.<br>
My erstwhile opponent, Sen. Sergio Osmeña, has gone to see Pres. Soeharto of Indonesia, and as reported by Ambassador Farolan, is determined to get the dormant concession of Brigido Valencia at Sumatra or East Kalimantan belonging to Americans. Accompanied by a representative of Nissio-Nurai, apparently the financier, this party surveyed the Sumatra concession of Valencia and apparently a favorable report submitted.<br>
Osmeña bragging here, in Japan and the Philippines that he can buy any Indonesian official. Apparently the funds to be used by the Adevoso group on their assassination and take-over plans will come from Osmeña. Osmeña is also in touch with the groups that are preparing a revolution in Sabah and has been instrumental in the offer by Malaysia or Sabahan authorities in offering to Princess Tarhata and Sultan Ismail Kiram to buy out their claim to Sabah. They may sell only their private rights. But I have ordered Sec. Romulo to write a formal letter to Sultan Ismail Kiram that he has authorized the Philippine government to bargain for him and that he must not embarrass our government; and for Amb. Busuego to informally notify the Malaysian authorities that Sultan Kiram cannot bind the Philippine government.<br>
Deputy Premier Tun Abdul Razak of Malaysia has announced a record U.S.$ 267.7 million budget for defense and internal security or 25% of the total expenditure of U.S.$ 1,080,130,000 for FY 1970. Defense budget for FY 1969 is U.S.$ 132M or 9.2% of the total 1969 budget. Razak justified the increase with the British military withdrawal and the stepped-up communist terrorist activities.<br>
In Pakistan 56 million registered to vote out of 125 million in Pakistan’s first general elections scheduled 4 Oct 1970.<br>

The IMF consultative committee headed by Mr. Zavkar will recommend devaluation. We cannot accept this.<br>
Osmeña filed a protest against me in the Presidential Electoral Commission yesterday. This will give us a chance to reveal what the Liberals did in the last elections.<br>
Gov. Licaros of the Central Bank informs me that the IMF team is meeting them tomorrow at 10:00 AM. So the Fiscal Policy Committee will see me here at the hospital at 8:00 AM.<br>
Amb. Addis of the United Kingdom is coming to bid goodbye at 10:00 AM.<br>
The boys, Vincent Recto, Monching Cojuangco, Joe Campos, Danny Vasquez all report that there is still rampant smuggling and <em>tong</em> collection at the Customs and the BIR.<br>
We will have to revamp the two offices or change the tax collection system. I have already authorized tax collection by the banks of some taxes.<br>
An elite team of young idealists can check on the payment of taxes of all goods in stores.<br>
In the export office, the subordinate personnel are still collecting or extorting money from exporters. We must stop this by catching some of them in the act.<br>
The Manila Times has become completely vicious. There are three false stories in its front page today: the headline of an alleged arms smuggling syndicate, including a northern congressman and a Chinese millionaire, the alleged offer by me to Villareal of the Secretaryship of Defense to placate him on the speakership fight, and the alleged resignation en masse of the Phil. Sugar Institute because of my designating Floro Cruz.<br>
So has Europa of the Evening News – the ungrateful cad. When he needed a job, he came begging. Now he is mean and carping.<br>
So are almost all the columnists.<br>
I intend to ignore these developments as usual and will turn to Television more and more.<br>
So I intend to order a bulletin fortnightly where we can express our government position and a weekly or biweekly telecast by Bob Garcia on the same. We must keep a well-integrated indexed file of all government positions.<br>
I will go to television with the Talkathon format on the eve of elections answering questions from the public in the audience or sent in by telephone.<br>

Imelda is strong enough to play host to her crowd nightly. We have just eaten Chinese lugao and lumpia brought in by Joe and Betty Campos. I liked most the <em>bajo</em> or powdered beef <em>tapa</em> and the seeweed for the lumpia. It is now 11:00 PM. Last night we went to bed at 11:30 PM. Read De Gaulle’s war memoirs up to 1:30 P.M. after writing my diary.<br>
I must soon write my war memoirs while the events are still fresh in my mind.<br>
Met with the fiscal policy committee at 8:00 AM here in the hospital and gave instructions to Com. Sychangco and Gov. Licaros to reconcile the figures on government deficits. The Central Bank has the figures at P1.1 billion cash deficit. Com. Sychangco says the cash deficit is only P600 million with savings of P283 million.<br>
I have also ordered Gov. Licaros to put down in a formal Aide Memoire to be handed to the IMF consultative committee our position that we will not agree to a devaluation and will take any measures short of it; — and to include the stabilization measures we have adopted including the allowance of the establishment of dollar accounts in Philippine banks with 100% dollar backing and to allow hotels to keep 25% of their dollar earnings because right now the dollar earnings of hotels has gone down to zero.<br>
I met with Piding Montelibano, who was brought to Pangarap by Bobby Benedicto. He has just recovered from the flu which is all over Europe and Asia.<br>
[<em>Marginal note</em>: We must now develop rural electrification under the new law passed last year and Schools of Arts and Trades. The British Ambassador who came to say goodbye also seems to agree these will bring about development faster.]<br>
Incidentally Col. Ver reports to me that Terry Adevoso, the mastermind of the assassination and military takeover of the government informed the conferees of the Junta in their meeting at the house of Commodore Alcaraz that the Vice President or the Lopez group has its own liquidation plot for me. I must look into this more deeply.<br>
I intend to have the EEA cases filed against Adevoso and Emmanuel Ocampo his operations man to keep them occupied. But at the same time we must obtain evidence for the filing of a case of conspiracy to commit treason. Apparently included in the plot is Col. Patterson, the U.S. Embassy military attaché, or so Adevoso says. Terry Adevoso said that he spoke to Ambassador Byroade about their plot and while the Ambassador was defending me he said that if he (Adevoso) had anything to ask or tell him, he (Adevoso) should talk to Patterson. Adevoso said that it was Patterson who suggested that Ayala and Nagtahan Bridges should be blown up so as to isolate Malacañang Palace during the attack.<br>
Included in the plot are Alcaraz, David Pelayo, Capt. Acosta of the Navy.<br>
Their target date is June or July this year.<br>

We have stopped the regular stipends to the columnists and newspapermen. This was started by Pres. Magsaysay in 1954. But we have to stop this corruption. This may be the cause of the harsh and even vicious attitude of the newspapers.<br>
I am still trying to ferret out the TV and radio commentators who are being bought. This has to be stopped too. The Commissioner of Civil Service, Abelardo Subido, has been found guilty in the investigation of his actuations in entering into contracts with himself. I have requested him to resign.<br>

Will meet with Gov. Licaros and Zavkar of the IMF tomorrow. Looks like Zavkar has no power to negotiate but has been instructed to propose devaluation of from 25% to 30% or a multiple rate of exchange. From reports, Zavhkar is of the belief that we will not be able to enforce a multiple rate of exchange. They want a budget surplus in the next six months – which we already have.<br>
The truth of the matter is everything – but everything is awaiting at a standstill the results of the consultations with IMF – both government and the private sector cannot move until we know what the BOP strategy is.<br>

Have met (at 11:00 AM up to lunch and 1:30 PM) with Dr. Zavhkar of the IMF and Gov. Licaros and have convinced him that instead of a 25% devaluation a floating rate would be better to be set about the later part of February. But 75% of the export earning of the traditional exports of sugar, coconut, lumber, minerals etc should be sold to the Central Bank at P3.90 per dollar and the remaining 25% goes to the exporter and can be sold at the floating rate, so as to attend to his requirements. Then we can lift the import budget but we would have to keep credit restraints for the next six months. The Central Bank will earn $600 million which can be used by the public sector only after six months. We can now lift guarantees at a certain level provided they are at least for five years – specially for export oriented industries. We still must restrain travel, public spending and luxury imports. We must raise P600 million by new taxes. The strongest argument that apparently convinced him was the violence that might attend devaluation; the demand for increase of wages and salaries.<br>
He is correct though that if we merely engaged in restrictions, the economy would be stagnant while the prices would go up anyway because of the reduction in production and imports. Then there would also be mass lay-offs in the factories.<br>

And we received the news at 10:30 AM when I was awarding the Philippine Legion of Honor degree of Commander to Lt. Gen. Gideon, CF of the 13th Airforce. He goes to Dayton, Ohio, where it is 4 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.<br>

I have been able to settle the Senate Presidency at 3:30 PM. Puyat remains and Roy becomes Executive Vice President of the Nacionalista Party as well as President Pro Tempore. Tolentino remains as majority floor leader.<br>
We have organized the panel of lawyers to handle the defense in the protest filed by Osmeña. They are Ex-Chief Justice Paras, Ex-Justice Ozaeta, Don Quintin Paredes, Dean Vicente Abad Santos, Joe Africa and my classmate Ramon Aquino. The offices of Tañada, Pelaez and others who are as senators disqualified from appearing before the Presidential Electoral Tribunal, will be listed as appearing as counsel for me. Offices will be established at the Northern Lines Bldg. Jose Africa will be the Vice Chairman of the panel; possibly Ex-Justice Ozaeta will be the Chairman.<br>
A disturbing piece of news from Joe Maristela is that Gens. Ileto and Tanabe have promised support to the Adevoso Junta in their assassination and coup d’etat planning. We must check this and neutralize them. But I will first personally meet with Joe Maristela tomorrow night.<br>
This is compounded by the fact that the process will necessarily go up if we set free the rate of exchange. Then we will impose more taxes and for the next six months we will not be able to relax credit or government expenses, nor imports. I must increase the entry of tax-free goods into the Free Trade Zone and soon.<br>
One of the PSA (Intelligence) Sgt. Retuta, in civilian clothes as a photographer was mauled by the student demonstrators today in front of the palace. No reason except that he was allegedly infiltrating. This should get us some sympathy.<br>
The demonstrators (some ten of them) are still there with their mike shouting unprintable and vicious imprecations at me, Meldy and everybody. You can hear them in all rooms of the Palace except our bedroom and the study.<br>
They want P10 million to be released to their schools for such things like a gym for the Phil. Normal College. These public works releases have been suspended in accordance with the new policy of priorities and savings in the last six months of this fiscal year of P243 million.<br>
We will have to tolerate such irritating demonstrations until we lift this policy.<br>

I have just talked to Joe Maristela who is our informer in the Adevoso group planning a coup d’etat. He feels the plan, though fantastic, is serious. Their next meeting is at his house in Antipolo next Wednesday. And the political group backing them up may attend. He feels they have not yet talked to or gotten the support of Gens. Ileto and Tanabe but that Adevoso and Sanchez said “Kasama natin yan.”<br>
He attends a breakfast with Gen. Yan tomorrow at 7:30 AM.<br>
A Col. Navarro now in Vietnam who may be in the CIA and ex-Col. Francisco Jimenez as well as Marcelo Castillo (Annapolis 1939) are with them.<br>
He and Col. Ver have already planned the planting of some more officers and men in the Adevoso group.<br>
Adevoso says that my erstwhile opponent and he went to see Byroade after the elections. While Byroade was apparently non-committal he allowed Adevoso to talk to his staff who (Adevoso says) thought of the idea of a coup d’etat, Patterson DOD attaché suggesting that in order to cut off Malacañang from reinforcements, the three bridges, Quezon bridge, Nagtahan bridge and Ayala bridge be blown up.<br>
Col. Francisco Jimenez’s car was in Commodore Alcaraz’s residence last Saturday in their last meeting, although he (Jimenez) was not there. Jimenez is on of the Valeriano boys. This is a new variable.<br>
Joe and Col. Ver suggested that we meet force with force and that the conspirators be eliminated quietly before they prejudice our country and democratic institutions. I told them that instead we should obtain evidence to prosecute them in court.<br>
For otherwise we may unleash a wave of violence we may not be able to control and do greater damage to our freedoms.<br>

I have just directed the retirement of Gen. Raval and all the extended generals effective Feb 1st and April 1st. I will retain Gen. Yan as Chief of Staff only because there is no one who is qualified to take his place. I will put Gen. Eddie Garcia presently CG of the Tabak Division as PC chief.<br>
I do sympathize with Gen. Raval who claims  he had nothing to do with the abuses of the Special Forces but there is discontent in the rank and file of the Armed Forces and Gen. Raval is one of the reasons. Another is the feeling of the lower ranking officers that they have no hope of advancement. And with the efforts of the Liberals to intrigue the military into a coup d’etat, it becomes necessary to remove all causes of grievance.<br>
The truth of the matter is the retiring officers are better than those who will succeed them. I hope to place some of them in civilian positions.<br>
I cannot choose a replacement of Sec. Mata. I am trying to get a civilian and non-military man. But I guess I will ultimately push Gen. Yan up to Secretary of National Defense while I ultimately push Ileto up to Chief of Staff.<br>

The President must do almost everything in the government. Nothing moves unless he pushes it.<br>
So I had to meet the student demonstrators themselves. Their speeches were getting obscene and lewd. I told them that I was sad that they could not deliver more moving speeches in more elegant language. We settled the matter but I frankly told them no release of funds until after July.<br>
I met with the labor leaders for breakfast after the oath-taking of the new Court of Appeals Justices including Vicente Rafael, labor leader is objected to by Justice Roman Ozaeta of the Philippine Bar Association, as he (Vicente) was allegedly an undistinguished labor practitioner. Also met the extended generals who I am retiring. Gen. Sangalang says he has no truck provided that they will all be terminated at the same time. I referred the suggestion to the Sec. of Nat. Defense thru the C of S Gen. Yan.<br>
Sec. Romualdez has his misgivings about the plan to free the rate of exchange and to allow it to seek its own level. He is worried it may plunge down too low. Dr. Zabvkar says from his experience it will not. Anyway I have ordered that we be ready with some foreign exchange to support a more stable rate and to finance the importation of essentials.<br>

Opening session of Congress. State of the Nation Address and Riots by the demonstrators in front of Congress.<br>
Two students reported killed. Phil. Gen. Hospital Dir. Pascual reports 45 demonstrators and 5 policemen treated. Cars in Congress destroyed like that of Sen. Roy.<br>
The invocation of Father Pacifico Ortiz, Ateneo head, was in poor taste. It castigated the government referring to goons, high prices, streets not being safe, the threat of revolution and how the citizens were ready to fight for their rights even in the barricades.<br>
It was an attempt at the state of the nation. I hope he is happy with what he has helped to bring about.<br>
Raul Manglapus engineered this with the help of the Jesuits apparently for all the Catholic schools had delegations. But apparently they were infiltrated by the Kabataan Makabayan who with some students started the violence.<br>
After the State of the Nation address, which was perhaps my best so far, and we were going down the front stairs, the bottles, placard handles, stones and other missiles started dropping all around us on the driveway to the tune of a “Marcos, Puppet” chant.<br>
As the intelligence reports it, the demonstrators had brought a coffin which they carried from the street below to the site of the flagpole, when they pushed it into the faces of the policemen. The policemen then threw the coffin to the street below and may have hit two demonstrators. The latter then took out a stuffed alligator from inside the coffin and threw it at the policemen who threw it back. Then the wood, bottle and stone throwing which caught us at the front stairs. I could not go into the car as Imelda kept standing on the stairs. Col. Ver tried to push me inside but I ordered the First Lady to be fetched and put inside first. Since she could not be pulled by anyone, I had to do it myself. I am afraid I pushed her into the car floor much too hard. Anyway I bumped my head behind the right ear against the car’s door side and twisted my weak right ankle again. We moved out under a hail of stones. But the PSA agent covering me, Agent Suson, was hit in the forehead and left eyelid and took four stitches. I thought it was Col. Ver as his barong was splashed with splotches of blood but Suson’s blood had spilled on him as he was on my right.<br>
We saw some of the action over television after we arrived at the palace.<br>
Raul Manglapus is hoping to become the President of the Constitutional Convention.<br>
And the extremists are using these demonstrators to provoke violence for their purposes.<br>
Some advisors are quietly recommending sterner measures against the Kabataang Makabayan. We must get the emergency plan polished up.<br>

Imelda left for Leyte to attend the installation of the Bishop of Palo. Have just called her up by phone patch. She says Ulot is so beautiful, the Papal Nuncio says it is more beautiful than Napoli. The moon is out. It is a three quarter fading moon.<br>
Met with all the Chiefs of Police in the Metropolitan area, the Metrocom Chief &amp; his staff, the PC chief and his staff and the NBI chief. Asked Col. Tamayo and Barbers to report on the rioting yesterday. I requested that the charges against the students be dropped; charges against non-students can continue; that a critique be made of the conduct of the men in uniform; that steps be taken to prevent any injuries to demonstrators in the future as there are reports of individual cases of policemen using more force than necessary. The MPD Chief explained that in the melee and the mob action, it was difficult to say what are the proper limits to the use of force to meet force. They asked for additional equipment as the policemen have to buy their own helmets and baton. About 19 policemen were injured.<br>
As reported by Ignacio Lacsina, his NUTC men in the rally saw Roger Arienda and his men start the rioting by throwing the coffin, the stuffed crocodile and stones at my car. I have asked Col. Ver to get their affidavits.<br>
I also met at 10:45 with Ambassador Byroade whom I quietly confronted with the story the Liberals are spreading openly that the American Embassy is supporting an attempt at a coup d’etat. He claims they only listened to the need for a coup. I told him of Patterson’s suggestion to blow up the bridges to isolate Malacañang. He seemed stunned and said he was greatly concerned and would do something about it. He said as long as he &amp; Nixon were in position we would not be fighting Americans.<br>
[Marginal note: I am a little relieved by his apparent willingness to cooperate with me.]<br>

January 28, 1970<br>
Wednesday 11:50 PM<br>
The pattern of subversion is slowly emerging. The danger is now apparent to me but not to most people.<br>
The conspiracy to grab power and assassinate me and about a hundred officers. The terrorism in Central Luzon with the HMB’s and the Ma-Mao holding some towns in their power. The repeated cases of liquidation of government sympathizers, informers and agents; the pink intellectuals, writers, professors and students and fellow travelers. Then the time bomb in Jusmag. The riot in Congress last Monday. Now the UP faculty marches to Malacañang tomorrow and denounces police brutality and holds the administration responsible for the “policy of repression” and the “violation of rights”. Then another mass demonstration that may lead to another riot next Friday notwithstanding promises of Gargaritano, the Security officer of the student demonstrators [in the conference this afternoon in the palace] that he will coordinate with MPD chief Tamayo to maintain peace.<br>
And I am certain this is just the beginning. The newspapermen I have in my list are busy placing the government in disrepute and holding it in contempt before the people. The sabotage and the killings will continue. The slow chipping at the people’s confidence in government authority. If we do not prepare measures of counter-action, they will not only succeed in assassinating me but in taking over the government.<br>
So we must perfect our emergency plan.<br>
I have several options. One of them is to abort the subversive plan now by the sudden arrest of the plotters. But this would not be accepted by the people. Nor could we get the Huks, their legal cadres and support. Nor the MIM and other subversive [or front] organizations, nor those underground.<br>
We could allow the situation to develop naturally then after massive terrorism, wanton killings and an attempt at my assassination and a coup d’etat, then declare martial law or suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus – and arrest all including the legal cadres.<br>
Right now I am inclined towards the latter.<br>
The student demonstrators seem to want a parliamentary form of government.<br>
If I want to be perpetuated in power, this is the easier way to it, with a constitutional provision that there shall be no elections unless a majority of all members of a unicameral legislature should adopt a formal resolution asking for such elections – and the powers of the Prime Minister are those of the President now.<br>

Thursday<br>
The UP faculty had a demonstration this afternoon. They walked from Agrifina Circle to Malacañang, handed me a manifesto blaming the administration for “the pattern of repression.”<br>
No mention at all about who started the stoning nor the danger to the First Lady and me – nothing but police brutality.<br>
Dean Majul claimed they were referring to the government in general and that he who heads a house is responsible for the happenings in that house. Dean Escudero of Business Adm. says he was a Marcos Liberal and that it is a matter of faith. Dean Feria (apparently an American lady) of English says there was brutality, that her 17 year old daughter was near our car and did not see any stone thrown (she must need glasses otherwise where did the wound of Agent Tuson in the forehead come from). Dr. Francisco Nemenzo arrogantly proclaimed he was not content with the manifesto but after “seeing my reaction to it”, he was happy. I had said that I was disappointed in the faculty of my alma matter; that the UP was charged as the spawning ground of communism and that the manifesto was full of ambiguous generalities that had a familiar ring to them. Then I read a report that he had said he wanted the members of the faculty to be hurt by the police and that he had given directions to the Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation to prepare gasoline (apparently for Molotov cocktails), stones and other missiles to be used in the Friday (Jan. 30th) rally, and that in the charge of communism in the UP, his name was mentioned.<br>
Tomorrow, the big student rally. But Gargaritano of the youth reform movement says the NUSP and the NSI will not come to Malacañang but go to Congress instead. The Kabataan Makabayan will come to Malacañang, though.<br>
Mayor Villegas has said that he will not allow the police to be near the demonstrators. I ordered him in writing to maintain peace and order in all rallies and demonstrations. He sent word that his press release did not mean he would keep the police away.<br>
I showed to the UP professors the <em>Collegian</em> which carried the communist party articles and said that I did not wish to stop this but that I hoped that the two sides of the question would be ventilated. VP Lopez called the editor of the <em>Collegian</em> a leftist.<br>

Still very quiet. The Kabataang Makabayan has been able to muster only about a hundred demonstrators before Malacañang. To cover up their inadequate number, they have gone to Congress where the NUSP under Jopson and the NSL have a more impressive number. Ollera has alerted Gargaritano. There is a congressional hearing at 3:00 PM. At six o’clock the leaders come to Malacañang for a conference.<br>
I continued the dialogue with the students – this time from CLSU, with the various student leaders like Jose Sayson, this morning.<br>
1:00AM Jan 31st –The Ma-Maos and Dante Kabataang Makabayan are leading the rioting outside.<br>
The riot is still going on but the Metrocom under Col. Ordoñez and Aguilar after reinforcement by one company of the PC under Gen. Raval arrived have pushed up to Mendiola near San Beda where the MPD were held in reserve. I hear shooting and I am told that the MPD have been firing in the air.<br>
The rioters have been able to breach Gate 4 and I had difficulty to stop the guards from shooting the rioters down. Specially as when Gate 3 was threatened also. I received a call from Maj. Ramos for permission to fire and my answer was “Permission granted to fire your water hoses.”<br>
So no shooting inside the Malacañang compound. Otherwise it would have been a massacre.<br>

10:00 AM<br>
I write this tonight having been a little occupied last night during the demonstration or riot. I am glad I was able to hold back on the repeated requests to fire at the rioters, the first request when they took over a fire truck burned it and rammed it against Gate 4 broke the lock and rushed into the compound near the new Administration Bldg, the second when they threatened to do the same on Gate 3.<br>
Have delivered a TV speech, called all the mayors of Metropolitan Manila and Gen. Rodriguez to work out a coordinated plan. Mayor Villegas kept explaining why the MPD police did not come to help us in Malacañang (nor the fire trucks of the MFD either).<br>
Conferred with the military (Sec. of Nat Def, Chief of Staff, Chiefs of the major services and their staffs.)<br>
Then with the political leaders.<br>
Most felt there should be no repression. So I have had to delay the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. We will await developments. I understand the demonstrators will hit the PNB and Metropolitan Branches next. The PCC demonstration of Prudente was called off. But I gather there will be a big demonstration next Tuesday and/or Mar. 3rd.<br>
When they do so again, they may be armed with firearms. In the meantime I can only gnash my teeth and wait.<br>
These are difficult days for everybody. But I pity the citizenry caught in the crossfire last night. For the rioters were sniping at the MPD, Metrocom &amp; soldiers with .22’s.<br>
I suppose that the people now sympathize with me, specially if these vandals continue their destructive anarchy.<br>
But Chino Roces still seemed hostile in the meeting with the publishers when I requested support for my position in the matter of the rioters. And Teddy Locsin tonight could not see in it anything but that reform must come by violent means. I had forgotten that he had always written sympathetically of Mao Tse Tung.<br>
We should ride this out with patience and perseverance.<br>
Teddy apparently was warning me that if there was repression by the arrest of the leaders of the communist movement, there would be retaliation and Central Luzon would be transferred to Manila with the slums becoming the jungle.<br>
If I let these fears deter me from fighting communism then we are lost. But I must continue to restrain myself lest we lose the support of the people by a stance of tyranny.<br>

A Fr. Sheffeld of Germany is living in Ateneo and approves the expenditure of the Adenauer fund supposedly for research on constitutional reforms. This is alien intervention in internal affairs.

Fr. Otazu, Rector of San Beda warns that the San Beda Towers if taken by the rioters could overlook Malacañang. So I have ordered it to be secured. Both felt that I have taken too soft a stand against the rioters and that the students do not believe my warning yesterday.<br>
Perhaps they are right but we must not adopt a stance of arrogance but of humility. And if the terrorism continues then we must meet force with force. Only however if the anarchists continue the sabotage and terrorism.<br>
I asked Gen. Balao, now Reparations Minister in Tokyo and former Defense Secretary to take over the Defense portfolio tonight. Sec. Mata was drunk during the crisis on Friday night as he is drunk every night. He is not only useless. He is a security risk.<br>

<strong>“WHY I AM FIGHTING COMMUNISM”</strong><br>
<strong>Office of the President</strong><br>
<strong>of the Philippines</strong><br>
<strong>Malacañang</strong><br>
February 1, 1970<br>
To my children, Imee, Bongbong and Irene:<br>
Why I am fighting Communism<br>
**1.**Because it does not believe in God. It believes that everything that happens is brought about by man alone. It believes in the theory of dialectic materialism. I believe in God.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="590" data-line-end="591">Under communism, a man has no rights. He is a creature of the State. It is the State that is glorified not man. So man becomes a slave under communism.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="591" data-line-end="592">Under communism, a man has no freedom. In contradistinction to democracy where individual freedom is sacrosanct, communism does not allow such simple liberties as freedom of thought, speech and religion among many others. There is no such thing as dissent or debate or dialogue.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="592" data-line-end="593">Correspondingly, under communism a man may own no land as he may not own any production goods. The cry of land for the landless is a mere shibboleth. For the land belongs to the state and the farmers are only slaves of the state. The farmers get a share of the produce byt only such share as the State arbitrarily dictates.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="593" data-line-end="594">Communism is a totalitarianism or a dictatorship by the elite who have acquired power through force, killing, murder and coercion. Prime examples are Stalin and Mao Tse Tung.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="594" data-line-end="595">Correspondingly the common people that communism is supposed to serve do not have any share in government nor in decision-making. Communism does not allow such simple processes as an election or voting or political campaigns. Everything is dictated by the few or the man on top who got there by force or violence.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="595" data-line-end="596">The common people, the laborers, farmers and the employees, cannot rise beyond their level. They cannot send their children to school to become lawyers, doctors, engineers, teachers or attain any profession they may wish. The State, meaning the ruling elite, determines what the people become. There is no alternative.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="596" data-line-end="597">Communism gives no inducement to genius, talent, perseverance and hard work. Everybody is pulled down to a common wage or salary except the rulers who live in a state of luxury and privilege.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="597" data-line-end="599">Communism ostensibly seeks to eradicate the ruling or influential oligarchies. But it succeeds in only replacing them with a worse group – the ruling or influential cliques and elite who actually rule without the approval or consent of the people. These group of elitists cannot be changed except by violence or force – by a revolution.<br>
10. Communism ostensibly seeks to drive away the foreign colonialists in the Philippines, the Americans. But it would place the Philippines under a new alien power – Red China, which is worse. Our country should be free and not dominate by any alien power.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="599" data-line-end="603">Communism believes in violence as the principal weapon of policy or of change. “Power comes out of the barrel of a gun,” is its principal dictum. Everytime there has been change in a communist country, there has been killing, arson, pillage and destruction – wasteful, merciless and senseless. In contradistinction to this, democracy offers change through the democratic process of elections and free speech in the open market of ideas. The process may be creaky, unwieldy and sometimes frustrating, but comparatively, it is humane, Christian, wiser, more democratic and less wasteful.<br>
Let us improve the house we now have, [which] we call democracy – for it has defects. But let us not burn it down.<br>

12:20 AM<br>
It seems clear now that the demonstrations and riots are engineered by the Liberal Party, Commander Dante and the Lopezes. The affidavit of a student leader, Villalon, attests to seven meetings in the office of my opponent Osmeña and Liberal Party President Gerry Roxas where these events were planned.<br>
But we must calm everybody down as the rumors of a revolution are widespread and the rich in Forbes Park have fled their beautiful homes. I have told the PA Commander (Gen Ileto) to patrol Forbes Park.<br>
After the calm, we can then attend to the enemies of the Republic one by one.<br>
Pressure must be put on Dante so he will not be of help to the Liberals in Manila. Perhaps we should get Sumulong to give Dante a work out to keep him busy or eliminate him. Will tell the military this.<br>
Then we must develop the case against the Liberals and the Lopezes so we can proceed against them legally.<br>
But we must move fast as the Liberals have July as their target date and the Communists Jan. 1971 (the latter information) according to Villegas whom I saw secretly at Pangarap tonight.<br>

The threat to turn the funerals of the four dead students into a mass rally has failed so far as the parents of the victims refused to allow the dead bodies to be further utilized to inflame the youth.<br>
There is comparative quiet although there was a scare of the students entering and burning the fashionable villages of Forbes Park, Urdaneta, Magallanes, etc, and the rich residents have evacuated. As Teddy Locsin said quoting the good book “The guilty flee where no one pursueth while the innocent are bold as a lion.<br>
With the statements of the young student leader Villalon and the former CIS chief Joe Maristela, I am now convinced that the Liberals have planned and organized these demonstrations in preparation for an alleged revolution.<br>
We must unmask these would be anarchists hiding behind children.<br>
And now Ninoy Aquino, Manny Pelaez and even Doy Laurel have started to discredit the Armed Forces. They delivered their privilege speeches yesterday.<br>

[<em>Marginal note</em>: Played golf with the Malacañang reporters at 5:00 PM]<br>
1:30 AM —<br>
Everything has returned to normalcy. But I feel that the HMB’s with Dante and Ninoy masterminding them are planning some sabotage.<br>
Talked to Ex-Sen. Rodolfo Ganzon and Ex-Rep Raschid Lucman and his wife Princess Tarhata.<br>
I have asked Roding Ganzon to infiltrate the LP. He says that Lopez, Laurel and Osmeña have agreed on an NP-LP ticket in 1973. Osmeña wants to run again and Doy Laurel may be his Vice. But of course Gerry Roxas and Ninoy Aquino want to run as President.<br>
And Lucman I asked to keep peace in Lanao and to placate the Liberals.<br>
Boni Isip, Joe Luckban and Johnny Echiverri saw me. They told me of Joe Maristela and of Ex-Sen Estanislao Fernandez urging the students to attack at Mendiola and plying them with whiskey from a jeep without any number and loaded with whiskey bottles.<br>
I hope to see Rep. Salipada Pendatun, brother in law of Ex. Gov. Udtog Matalam, leader of the Moslem Independence Movement, tomorrow. As well as Ex-Sen. Domocao Alonto and Ex-Gen. Alonto.<br>
We are building pillboxes at the gates and mortar defenses including baffled walls for my gymnasium where we can seek shelter in case of mortar attack.<br>
We have cleared the lawn west of the veranda and ceremonial hall for a helicopter landing this side of the Palace complete with night landing lights.<br>
We are preparing anti-subversion cases against Arienda and the leaders of the Kabataang Makabayan.<br>
I feel that ultimately we must have a confrontation with the communists in this country. And that their eradication as a threat to our free way of life may be one of my main missions. It is true that if we can keep on delaying and delaying their take-off and cut off their momentum we will ultimately win, but it will be a messy and tedious job. Now we have an opportunity – perhaps the only opportunity to liquidate the movement in one clean sweep – if we plan it well enough.<br>
Thus if there is massive sabotage and an attempt against my life, then I might be compelled to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and arrest all the persons in the list of communists.<br>
This will be the total solution to the ideological impasse!<br>

Called Ambassador Byroade to find out if they (the Americans) are supporting me in the fight against the subversives. He said they would. Whatever they have done to encourage intransigence among the Liberals, we should neutralize them before a total confrontation with the communists. To satisfy the American ego I asked for the accelerated delivery of the helicopters and some ammunition for both training and combat.<br>
My principal worry, however, is the effect of the IMF program of a free rate of exchange. This will cause further increase in prices beyond the reach of the common man. My barber, Conrad, tells me that money is becoming scarce.<br>
Byroade handed me his letter informing me that Pres. Nixon would like to receive me in California in mid or late August. I have accepted the invitation but I have delayed the publicity. This may cause another demonstration.<br>
Asked Rep. Salipada Pendatun to keep peace in Cotabato and put some sense into the Liberals.<br>
We are now preparing for the military confrontation with communism. Legal studies on whether an arrest can be made without warrant if I suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and if the arresting officer can be charged for illegal detention when the writ is restored. Then an assessment of the evidence against the target personalities.<br>
We must prepare for a legal fight.<br>
<strong>ATTACHMENT</strong><br>
<strong>Letter of Ambassador Byroade (Page 1 of 2)</strong><br>
Manila, Philippines<br>
February 3, 1970<br>
Dear Mr. President:<br>
You will undoubtedly recall that in your recent discussion with Vice President Agnew, the latter extended President Nixon’s invitation for you to pay a visit to the United States and suggested late 1970 or early 1971. During that conversation mention was made of the fact that many Heads of States would be going to America for the Twenty-fifth Anniversary Session of the United [Nations]. The Vice President later pointed out to you his thought that this would hardly be good timing from our point of view as with so many visitors it might be difficult to give your own visit the priority and attention that he knew President Nixon would desire. I believe, but am not certain, that Vice President Agnew suggested that a later date might be preferable.<br>
I now have the authority to explore with you the possibility of a somewhat earlier date of mid or late August. If such timing would prove convenient to you, I am informed that President Nixon would like to receive you in California as he has found that that locale has proven ideal for comparable state occasions. I have been informed also that he would like a Pacific coast setting<br>
 <br>
His Excellency<br>
Ferdinand E. Marcos<br>
President of the Republic of the Philippines<br>
<strong>(Page 2 of 2)</strong><br>
for the actual meeting with you as he feels this would lend emphasis to the mutual interests of our two countries in the Pacific community.<br>
I will be most pleased, of course, to pass along your thoughts on this matter.<br>
Sincerely,<br>
(Sgd.) Henry A. Byroade<br>

Poor Banjo Raval (Gen. Vicente Raval) the Chief of PC. He is one of the most loyal of the officers in the Armed Forces. I have asked him to seek relief as PC Chief. Instead of Gen. Eduardo Garcia, I may have to put Gen. Tanabe temporarily.<br>
I intend to make a sweeping reorganization of the cabinet, financing institutions and the tax collecting offices. So I meet with the Development Council tomorrow to chart the program on social legislation. This will include price and rent control, special funds for peace and order and for land reform. Housing and resettlement must receive priority attention.<br>
Have met with Labor Leader Ignacio Lacsina (NATU), Peasant leader Felixberto Olalia (Masaka) and Kabataan Makabayan leader Carlos del Rosario brought in be Sec. Blas Ople. They have asked a more nationalistic policy. I told them that it has saddened me to be driven to the refuge of anti-communism and pro-Americanism. I offered them the opportunity to obtain loans from the Eastern European Socialist countries; retirement of Gen. Raval and the disbandment of the “monkees” as well as the prosecution of Col. Tomas Diaz and his men for the alleged kidnapping of Alabado. They promised in turn to call off the Feb. 12th rally and to meet with me on Tuesday Feb. 10th at 5:00 PM at the State Dining Room.<br>

Met Byroade who says we can pick up the tear gas next Monday. The dye will be forthcoming and he hopes he can divert to the Philippines three helicopters for Vietnam and two for Thailand. He says he has to fight the Vietnan priority.<br>
Tonight I also met with Roger Arienda, one of my most bitter critics who has been leading demonstrations. He was brought by Col. Simeon Medalla. Of course he suggested that he puts up an office to receive complaints and funds to support the office. He now supports me.<br>
Submitted to the National Development Council the priority legislative program as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="700" data-line-end="701">Price and Rent Control Law</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="701" data-line-end="715">Special funds for:

<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="706" data-line-end="715">Tax collection improvement<br>
Doy Laurel proposed the inclusion of judicial and penal reforms.<br>
But they opposed the proclamation of all of Luzon as a land reform area allegedly for lack of funds to finance the tenants. We agreed to finance the existing land reform areas first. Otherwise we would lose further credibility.<br>
I had to tell the Senators and Congressmen that the demonstrators and the radicals felt that Congress was hopeless because it was moving along as slowly as usual and not acting as if there was need for immediate change.<br>
Met with my cabinet to inform them that we had to meet the demand for change. So everybody held himself available for replacement. I have prepared a proposed revamp.<br>
But in the <em>Manila Times</em>, Pastalero, former UP Student Council President, follows Barican’s line that I should resign. So it is not constitutional reforms they want but a change of President. This should unmask them.<br>
<em>Manila Times</em> has become impossible. Chino Roces has become a juramentado. He asked the Umali group of farmers to join the demonstration on the 12th so as to get me to resign in three months. He must be a mental case as I always suspected. Manang Pacita says he is trying to prove his manhood elsewhere as he is inadequate at home.<br>
Rudy Tupas and Abe Cruz who saw Imelda claim they will be able to stop him from inside the <em>Manila Times</em>.<br>

Sunday<br>
11:15 PM–<br>
I have sworn in the new cabinet members during my speech before the Constitutional Convention members during the cocktail for them at 5:00 PM at the reception hall except for the new Executive Secretary, Alex Melchor whom I swore in the evening at 7:10 when Iñing Lopez and Nanding, Heny Lopez and the <em>Chronicle</em> and ABS-CBN staff came to have dinner with us.<br>
Iñing was very touchy, even arrogant, Heny was non-committal and IP Soliongco kept reapeating that nothing would be the same again and that we would have to listen to the voice of the students as this was the voice of the people.<br>
I kept repeating to Ernie Granada that he should not push me to Byroade and the Americans.<br>
It is my feeling that the Lopezes are going to do their best to undermine against us.<br>
Met with Tony Pastalero brought by Angel Concepcion, former secretary of Sen. Camilo Osias, as well as Fernando (Gerry) Barican this noon for lunch with the first and the latter at 4:00 PM. They both promised to stop the talk about my resignation after I convinced them that if I were not around the military would take over. This is apparently feared by everyone including them.<br>
Barican today has warned of a take over by the Jesuit-Fascist-CIA combine.<br>
We really should warn our people of this. But today I met also with the Jesuit novices who want to be strengthened by my granting their demands (of the NUSP). I agreed to this to widen the split between them (the moderates) and the radicals.<br>

I write this as I wait for a visitor who will inform us of all the conspiracy going on behind the Liberal Party. Osmeña has just delivered a privilege speech in the Senate denying his connection with the demonstrators and the riots and rehashing his charges about the elections.<br>
Villalon testifying before the Senate-House Joint Committee should blast this claim to pieces. Col. Jimmy Barbers has asked for an opportunity to present him next Wednesday at 9:00 AM.<br>
Went out of the Palace (for the first time since Jan. 30, 1970) to attend the 31st Anniversary of the Phil. Navy set at 9:00 AM. Stayed until 11:00 AM. Commissioned the new 25-know 87 ft. patrol craft made in Singapore. Our Navy will duplicate it. We have a 100 ft. ferro-cement fishing boat in the making.<br>
Was gratified to see the people waving at me and clapping their hands. The public sympathy has returned to us since the attack on the Palace on Jan. 30th.<br>
Apparently the crisis is over – unless the Feb. 12th rallies turn into violent riots, God forbid.<br>
The whole family was in Scout uniform at the 5:00 o’clock investiture of Imelda and the opening ceremonies of the preparation for the 50th Anniversary of Scouting in 1973.<br>
Conferred with the two Cardinals, Santos and Rosales, on the Jesuits and bishops propagating radical ideas – like Father Ortiz, Murphy (Tom) and Blanco as well as the seven bishops who sent the open letter.<br>
Now even the student leaders are divided. They seem to be in a state of confusion. Tonight 25 students from the UP have seen the First Lady. Uncivil, arrogant but uninformed, naïve and confused.<br>
I see the KM and Labor leaders with Blas Ople tomorrow at 5:00 PM.<br>
But the NUSP is following the script of making demands which I am supposed to grant – to strengthen their hand. And they are supposed to picket Malacañang tomorrow.<br>
Even if the demonstrations should turn violent because the latest intelligence is that Commander Dante is supposed to be collecting hand guns in Concepcion and supposedly in the province of Tarlac, for use in Manila, it would still be favorable to us for the people are against violence – specially if it is against Malacañang Palace.<br>
We must recast the plans for a total solution of the communist problem. We must prepare for a long, tedious legal fight with the military stepping up the drive in Central Luzon and harassing raids in Novaliches, Caloocan and Parañaque where the HMBs and the Mao’s hold in when they escape from the PC raids in Central Luzon.<br>
Gov. Licaros sent a message through Bobby Benedicto who is agreed to going out on leave from the Presidency of the PNB, that his mission is a complete success.<br>
We will get the third tranche of $27.5 million $40 m from out gold $40 from the Federal Reserve Bank and $120 million from the consortium of banks plus a five year extension of our debts. If we can get $100 m from Japan, we will have all we need.<br>
Now all I am asking for is to be allowed to start working.<br>

We are succeeding in dividing the student leaders into the radicals and the moderates.<br>
Have had to grant some of their demands – things that I wanted to do anyway.<br>
But four enlisted men were killed at Mapalacsiao, Tarlac, by men believed to be Maos at 1:00 AM today.<br>
The demands of the radicals are socialistic if not communist – not merely nationalistic. We will have to play along with them, take away their steam while we go after the Maos and the HMBs.<br>
Imelda met with the two Cardinals, Archbishops Gonzaga and Alberto on the problem of the Jesuits and the ultra-liberal priests. They intend to put yup a magazine and a newspaper.<br>
Have asked Gen. Menzi to resign his position as Senior Aide so he can devote his full time to the <em>Bulletin</em>, <em>Liwayway</em>, his business interests and the preparation of a house in Australia and San Francisco if necessary.<br>

Commander Sumulong is going after Commander Dante in Tarlac. He says Dante was wounded in a previous skirmish and may be moving around in a hammock. Danding suspects that Ninoy Aquino is hiding him in either Antipolo, Puringay or in the Joe Rojas ranch in Bataan. Sumulong promises to get him.<br>
Col. Tomas Diaz is now Zone-2 and needs ₱80,000 for six civilian jeeps, one jeep each for the six teams and six more vehicles plus ₱10,000 monthly. We will start going after those Ma-Maos in a big way.<br>

Against predictions of violence, the Plaza Miranda rally turned out to be peaceful. Some of the leaders shouted for the crowd to go to Malacañang but the crowd would not follow.<br>
But the KM and SDK violated their word and went through with the rally in Plaza Miranda when they had said that they would not leave the campuses. Some 40 trucks came from Angeles City. The men in them did not look like students and they were the ones crying out for blood.<br>
The northern congressmen, senators and governors came to the palace with completely armed men. I dissuaded them from infiltrating the demonstration and inflicting harm on them.<br>
For a time I secretly hoped that the demonstrators would attack the palace so that we could employ the total solution. But it would be bloody and messy.<br>
Anyway I told the northern political leaders that the situation may develop into a revolutionary situation during my administration and that we should prepare for a military confrontation with the communists. The North should be developed as a last bastion, just in case. We must now cache arms and ammo there, prepare Laoag for jet landings, Lingayen Gulf for our navy and organize provincial strike forces, at the rate first of at least 100 men each province.<br>
But we must win the hearts and minds of our people. So, I argued, we must all be ready to sacrifice our personal interests for the common good. They agreed to this but begged that the men who had sacrificed in the political battles be not forgotten.<br>
We had dinner and a movie. Blas Ople was there for dinner. And so was Emong Salvador, my old Maharlika comrade. Blas is an enigma. Many of the leaders distrust him. Even Col. Ver feels that he is actually one of the communist leaders and that all the attacks in the media against me and the administration may have been his brainchild. But it is best he is in the palace when there is a crisis. Then we can neutralize him or use him.<br>
As of now I am convinced we have to wage a tedious legal, propaganda and economic battle against the communists. So this afternoon I asked the military leaders, Ponce Enrile, Yan, Garcia, and Ramos to prepare for this. There must be an assessment of the voluminous documents captured from the Ma-Maos – for legal action. The intelligence agencies must be sharpened to the sophisticated finesse of the intellectuals and urban communists. For this the NICA and NBI must be reorganized. And we must fund the various anti-subversion and anti-insurgency teams.<br>
If they want a revolution, I will give them one in the economic field. Drastic, dramatic and effective like the rechanneling of the excess money into agro-industrial projects in the farms and resettlement centers.<br>
I met with Vicente Araneta to listen to his priming plan. Assigned Usec. Roman Ong Jr. to study it.<br>

Col. Ver reports that de Leon has just come back from Samar where the men of Osmeña numbering about 300 are training with an American among them. We must find out if this is Larry Trackman. De Leon brought two samples of home made bombs – beer bottles with gun powder and a fuse.<br>
We must track down these training camps and eradicate them.<br>
Met with Father Blanco, the revolutionary priest. He seemed impressed with the crash program of employment with me calling the 600 biggest employers in the Manila area and asking them to take five to ten unemployed – then the housing program in Tondo, Tala Leprosarium, Sapang Palay, Carmona, San Pedro Tunasan; the free trade zone and the sale of essential commodities without payment of tariff or tax if necessary; the agro-industrial estates and the Magalang project under a private foundation, the Filipinas Foundation of the Ayalas.<br>
Have asked Sec. Melchor to start the housing project immediately with the DBP, PNB, GSIS and SSS contributing one million pesos each.<br>
Hope to be able to visit some community projects soon.<br>

Adevoso’s group has postponed its meeting set Wednesday. They must smell something.<br>
But de Leon says the barracks in this secret training place in Northern Samar is so camouflaged that it cannot be seen from the air. It is a long building roofed with galvanized iron over which tree bark and soil is spread. Two Americans went there four times in the about two weeks that he was there by small plane which are then covered with tree foliage. He does not know their names but will try to get their pictures as well as that of the place when they return Wednesday. He was with an Atty. Tumulak, Osmeña’s man, when he went there last.<br>
I have now asked the 3rd PC Zone Commander, Gen. Reyes, to come with the CIS officer, Maj. Manglongat. There is one Home Defense Force in this zone and it should be used against this camp.<br>
Gov. Licaros has called up by long distance to report that the IMF team’s (headed by Dr. Zabvkar) report will be submitted to the IMF Board next Friday the 20th and will be approved. The third credit tranche of $27.5 million will be granted, $40 million loan for Central Bank working balance from the consortium of 23 U.S. banks $40 million loan from the Federal Reserve Bank and possibly $60 million standby loan from the consortium. He leaves for Tokyo next Tuesday where we hope to borrow $200 million standby and $50 million trade credits.<br>
The dollar now costs ₱6.10 – a new high.<br>
This is what concerns me most because if it goes any lower, we will have inflation and instability. Then there may be riots.<br>
We must now pass the price control bill I certified last Thursday (Feb. 12th) and the rent control bill. Then we must allow the entry of essential commodities to be stocked in the Free Trade Zone at Mariveles.<br>
We must soon allow the expenditure of funds for highways and ports because while there is money in Manila, there is beginning to be a pinch in the provinces.<br>
I should record the attempt of Angel Nepomuceno, co-owner (with Bibit Duavit) of the Butterfly and who is now keeping Gerry Barican at his house, and Tony Pastalero to hold me up for ₱150,000 for alleged expenses during the Alcantara funeral when allegedly they used 250 students to prevent any untoward event – allegedly committed by Tony Raquiza. Tony Raquiza denied this to me yesterday when he came to see me playing golf alone at about 6:30 PM. He says he did not convey this to me as he found the proposal obnoxious as it smacked of blackmail.<br>
The students have their weaknesses.<br>

Was guest of honor of the convention for the merger of the two biggest labor unions, the P_C of Bert Oca and the PTUC of Pedro Fernandez at 4:00 PM at the GSIS auditorium. They constitute 65% of the organized labor force. They welcomed me warmly and applauded my speech enthusiastically. This will show that labor is on the side of government and not leftist as claimed by the KM and SDP.<br>
This is the second time I leave the palace. I should do so more often.<br>
Had lunch with Gen. Rancudo, CG of the Fifth Fighter Wing who swore undying loyalty even if the other elements of the AFP should turn disloyal. “One of my F-5’s can blast the Tabak Division installations in ten minutes,” he said. He said he is willing to fight even the Americans if necessary. I hurried to add that the Americans were on our side. He had the CAA Administrator, Fred Ablan, with him (he is another jet fighter pilot). I ordered Laoag airfield which is only 5000 long to be immediately lengthened to 10,000 so as to handle jet transport (commercial) as an alternative international airport. Actually this is to handle our jet fighters. The same thing with Zamboanga and Davao.<br>
I have given the project on the Osmeña training camp in Samar to Gen. Ben Reyes, III PC Zone Commander and his C/S Chief, Maj. Manglongat who strikes me as competent. Aerial photography may locate the area. And vertical envelopment by helicopter or by air drop may do the trick.<br>
Imelda is again very confident that I have things well in hand. So does Father Dougherty fee the same way.<br>

Spent practically the whole day attending to the problems of the Tondo foreshoreland  slum dwellers. They ask for the land reclaimed from the sea at North Harbor. Last year I gave ₱350,000 to the Bureau of Lands in their presence to spend for the survey and subdivision of the land into residential lots excluding the customs area and land set aside for roads, parks and recreational facilities which they now wish to do away with.<br>
I have given them the responsibility of deciding the conflicting claims and the problems of more than 5,000 applicants to only 3,000 lots if the parks, roads and recreational facilities are included as residential land. And I explained the program of housing (requesting that if it is necessary to accommodate several families in one lot they should agree to condominiums in three or two storey apartments), education through the foster-parent plan of businessmen and employment.<br>
Met with the business leaders on the Tondo problem of housing, education and employment.<br>
Then talked to the Blue Ladies on the capabilities of government to protect them and what government is doing to bring about change.<br>
Asked Enriquito Zobel in the businessman’s meeting to hurry up the Magalang project of the Filipinas Foundation.<br>

I have that feeling of certainty that I will end up with dictatorial powers if the situation continues – and the situation will continue. The HMBs and the Ma-Maos will continue to try to bring about a revolutionary situation. Massive sabotage is indicated by the crude bombs they are manufacturing and teaching their recruits to manufacture in their training camps. This also means they are not getting any aid (military) from outside. We should allow them to gather strength but not such strength that we cannot overcome them.<br>
We continue to meet the students – a tedious time consuming effort to placate them. For what? They will come back with some more demands later on. But the play must go on.<br>
We must establish a mass base. Father Calles suggests that the women who are getting impatient should be organized. I agree.<br>
Then we must get the Armed Forces working properly. A dry run for Plan X must now be executed.<br>
I talked to Ambassador Byroade and told him I needed his continuous support before I started the drive against the communists now and later when the ammunition is exhausted. There is not a single round of ammunition for our 35 rocket launchers. But we have just received our ammunition reloader.<br>

The rioters have just dispersed at the corner of Recto and Legarda (3,000 of them) with six grenades of tear gas thrown at 1:00 AM. The gas is still in the air as there is no wind. The 150 men under Lacsina who had been at Gate 4 since about 7:00 PM waited for the rioters that forced their way into the U.S. Embassy compound, burned the guardhouse, destroyed the glass windows of the buildings and threw bottles full of gasoline in an attempt to burn it down. They also wrecked all the shops and restaurants in Plaza Fergusson, at A. Mabini, U.N. Avenue and the Luneta. Part of Hilton Hotel destroyed.<br>
Ambassador Byroade called me to seek help as the U.S. Embassy had only a few guards. I directed Usec. Manuel Collantes to order Mayor Villegas to order the anti-riot squad to break up the rioters.<br>
The massing of 3,000 near Malacañang was apparently a prelude to another attack on the palace.<br>
This was a show of the Lacsina, Bert Olalia and Kabataang Makabayan groups.<br>
But they are moving forward to the need for the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus or martial law. Just a little bit more and we will have to.<br>
Met with the provincial governors and city mayors at [Camp] Aguinaldo for a briefing on the plan of the communists to take over the government and the need to organize strike forces of local municipal policemen which I authorized in March 1968. They want guns and ammo, funds and the lifting of public bidding in the purchase of police equipment – which I gave.<br>

Another violent demonstration like last night and according to our intelligence the next targets for sabotage are the public utilities and the big establishments, and I may have to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
Ambassador Byroade filed a strong protest for the vandalism, arson and destruction in the U.S. Embassy last night. I have asked Mayor Villegas to explain his inaction.<br>
Gen. Ordoñez of the Metrocom suffered head wounds last night.<br>
I asked Ernesto Rufino, Vicente Rufino and Carlos Palanca to withdraw advertisements from the Manila Times which was openly supporting revolution and the communist cause. They agreed to do so.<br>
I have convinced Maceda to stay in PACD and he still acted like a spoiled brat. I had to tell him that his employees were talking of his bringing women to the Executive Secretary’s office at night and that he was getting too arrogant.<br>
Gen. Rancudo has put up a SSB for direct communications between my office and the 5th Fighter Wing.<br>
The headline in the Bulletin has caused consternation among some senators as the secret orders if anything untoward happens to me has alarmed them of the military taking over. But this only if all the civilian government leaders are liquidated which is far-fetched.<br>

The report of the IMF and the solution acceptable to them has come in with Gov. Licaros. It is a multiple rate – a floating rate for all imports; all earnings of principal exports of copra, logs, sugar and copper concentrate to be surrendered to the Central Bank at the legal rate of ₱3.90 to the dollar except for 20% which will be allowed to be retained by the exporter and sold at the floating or free rate. Imports of luxuries and travel should be restricted. This will be an industrial development scheme. All the lesser exports will benefit and will be encouraged.<br>
It should be approved by our Monetary Board by now, effective tomorrow, Saturday, morning at 6:00 AM to coincide with the approval of the IMF Executive Board in Washington. We must watch prices.<br>
Met with Byroade and Jim Rafferty to offer my personal apologies. Those crazy Americans for a time thought that I had deflected the rallies from Malacañang to the U.S. Embassy to get them involved. Ridiculous!<br>
But Romulo is getting senile. That note of his in answer to the stiff protest of the Americans was off the beam. It speaks of there being valid ground for the attacks against the Americans and the Americans to ponder on the solution of the problems between the two countries. I have to replace Romulo soon. This is not the way to treat a wounded ally.<br>
More and more people are demanding sterner measures against the demonstrators. The Chamber of Filipino Retailers and small merchants demand protection for life and property.<br>

Nepomuceno with Eric Mendoza who is a former jet pilot resigned because of hazing and helping in the location of Dante and Arthur Garcia whom he confirms he met after the claim that he (Garcia) was killed by Dante, were also here. Gov. Nepomuceno is disturbed by my statement to him that his bodyguards are Dante’s men. So he is helping through Mendoza in the campaign to locate Dante.<br>
We mapped out the plans in the event of the massive sabotage of the city and the public utilities. Transferred some of the armor to Central Luzon. They missed Dante by a few hours in Capas the other day.<br>
But we have five companies [of] reserves for the Metrocom which has 1,339 men – one company each from the major services and one from GHQ. Then there are two HDF in Malacañang, two in Camp Crame and one in [Fort] Bonifacio. The different brigades are forming up. In the event of an emergency, the PA can organize two more complete battalions with equipment in Fort Magsaysay and Cebu for the April training.<br>
Our unanimous assessment is that the subversives have no capability of mounting an attack of company proportion and probably will not but are capable of small unit harassment, sabotage and liquidation which capability should also be eradicated.<br>

But the Lopez contributions to the radicals is their premium payments for insurance. They do not know that they would be the first to go if the communists take over.<br>

Ninoy Aquino attacked the fertilizer plant project of the sugar planters in a privilege speech – a project that I have already ordered to be suspended.<br>
Villalon testified before the Joint Committee to the effect that the Liberals specially Osmeña funded and encouraged the demonstrations. There must be consternation among the Liberals.<br>
Looks like the demonstrations will continue and they may become more violent.<br>

Imelda went to the Tondo slums and relates how the children are eating only once a day and in some instances three times a week. So we have decided to convert Tondo into a model city – as a priority project.<br>

Fiscal Policy Committee with the Congressional leaders met to assess the monetary situation. The Senate President and Aytona was helpful.

Puyat understood but as usual the Speaker did not understand the need for secrecy.<br>
Will start releasing funds for the provinces. Priority has been given to the Tondo project. I meet Enrique Zobel on the project next Friday afternoon.<br>
The trading this day on dollars quoted ₱5.70 to the dollar – much lower than we expected. The black market had reached ₱6.30. The persons who face dollar loan amortizations are complaining of the new policy for a floating rate as they will pay more in pesos but the exporters specially those not in the copra, sugar, logs and copper category are cheering it.<br>
Looks like we still have no funds in government. We should now have only one appropriation act to include even public works and capital expenditures.<br>

Very overwhelming affection and trust – so completely different from Manila.<br>
Rode in an open car – convertible with the top down. Imelda as usual was mobbed affectionately.<br>
Must go to the provinces more where the atmosphere is more representative of the nation.<br>
Met with Ex-Sen Domocio Alonto and asked him to help me prevent bloodshed in Moroland. He was reported having gone to Basilan and said that the country was in the grip of a revolution and the army 70% against the government. Of course he denied it and seemed obsessed with petty local politics.<br>
He was brought by Cong. Bert Sabido who kept repeating his requests for special favors – the Asst. Immigration Commissioner and allowances for the congressmen from savings in my office.<br>

The Supreme Court ruled the mayor of Manila can refuse to give a permit for a rally in Plaza Miranda and offer instead a permit for a rally in Sunken Gardens – in the name of peace and order.<br>
The demonstrators went to Sunken Garden then proceeded to the U.S. Embassy where they were kept away from the buildings by the MPD and the Metrocom. The demonstrators have wrought destruction in Plaza Fergusson, threw a few Molotov cocktails and destroyed the pots along the islands in some streets. The last group was in Galicia Street. They numbered 200 and challenged the police to take them. Tear gas bombs were used again. Even the citizens in their houses were affected by the tear gas.<br>
Enriquito Zobel came to see me and told me that it was not he and his group who had organized to fight me but that it was Hans Menzi who had said that he was asked to resign as a senior aide because he had written me a frank memorandum about government weaknesses and anomalies. Looks like Hans cannot be trusted any longer.<br>
The congressmen from the North were here again waiting for the demonstrators. They had dinner and a movie.<br>

The Manila Police early this morning (two hours after the rioting) raided the Philippine College of Commerce with a search warrant from Judge Jarencio and arrested 38 persons including students, professors and paid vandals with Molotov cocktails, revolvers, a shotgun and other weapons of assault. And the reaction of the public seems to be reacting favorably.<br>
Finished the problem of the Muslims. Salipada Pendatun says he will be responsible for Ex. Gov. Udtog Matalam the leader of the Muslim Independence Movement, who on Feb. 6, 1970 issued another manifesto against the government adopting the Ma-Mao and Kabataang Makabayan line. Salipada Pendatun insists there is no training ground for insurgents and that Udtog will consult him before he does anything serious. I have my doubts about his capability to hold Udtog but I am hoping for the best. I have asked him to bring Udtog’s son.<br>
Also settled the Sulu differences between Cong. Amin and Mayor Barby Abubakar of Jolo. It seems that Amin and Gov. Sangkula bring in policemen of the other towns fully armed into Jolo, causing tension. A barrio captain was killed by the policemen recently. So I am having the arms of the Jolo policemen who shot him and from now on no more guns from outside Jolo to be allowed.<br>

Am working on a Primer on Communism. Everyone is talking of confrontations with student power. Actually the whole crisis has been utilized by communism to create a revolutionary situation.<br>
Ernesto Granada, columnist of the Manila Chronicle has become libelous. He writes what Iñing Lopez tells him to. Today he blames me for the riots and for paying toughies to infiltrate the demonstrations and to destroy private property and thus raise the ire of the people against the demonstrators. We must watch out on the Lopez side. Mother has written me that one of the friends of Iñing Lopez has revealed to her that Iñing Lopez has paid some people to kill me. I can believe this.<br>
My barber, Conrad, tells me that the overwhelming opinion outside Malacañang is that it is about time I took sterner measures against the demonstrators that are violent.<br>
The Armed Forces had a critique of the exercises for the Contingency Plan. Defects being ironed out.<br>
We must finalize the list to be arrested if there is massive sabotage or assassination. I assess the plans of the communists to include these activities by the middle of March.<br>
Johnny Ponce Enrile reports demoralization among the HMBs specially the Ma-Maos who are ready to surrender but would like to make it appear like a capture.<br>
There is restlessness in the transportation sector as the bus operators are losing ₱.30 for each peso gross they earn.<br>
We will have to allow an increase in rates as the tire suppliers have increased prices by 17% and the oil people are meeting next Wednesday to increase theirs. I was able to hold the rates down in 1966. Today we will not be able to do this because of the floating rate.<br>
The Congress is moving as slowly as ever on urgent legislation like the price and rent control law.<br>
I have asked Bing Tanco to come and help me on the agricultural program. I hope to put him in as Undersecretary of Agriculture if I can convince Nanding.<br>
I have just appointed Gen. Estrada as Deputy Director of the National Intelligence Coordinating Agency.<br>
The cement shelter in the ground floor (my gymnasium) has just been finished. It is against any possible mortar or grenade attack.<br>
And I have been trying out my bullet proof vest as I was going to Bohol but had to cancel it as the East Visayan Athletic Meet is set for the afternoon and I have some appointments here in Manila. The vest is a little lumpy under my newly tailored barong and shirt. It weighs 13 pounds and protects from the most penetrating rifle fire.<br>

The KM’s yesterday agreed to hold a demonstration marching from the Quezon welcome arch to the U.S. Embassy passing by the Supreme Court. The demonstration bids well to be violent. Intelligence reports indicate that the radicals and communists may try and destroy the electric, water and telephone systems. They may try to burn or blast Congress and the Supreme Court. If they do I will suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and order the arrest of all the communist leaders once and for all. If this happens we have to be restrained and wise in the choice of persons to arrest.<br>
But this will set back the time table of the communists in the Philippines who have set their bid to take over the government this year or January 1971. It may be the better part of valor and wisdom to act now.<br>
Saw the film Julius Ceasar with John Gielgad, Paul Mason and Marlon Brando. Superb acting but it reminded me of the conspiracy going on now against me by all the envious men who have failed. Remind me to have my guards around me always. I have often wondered why Ceasar had no protection when he was assassinated.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1055" data-line-end="1060">I am quoted by the afternoon papers (Mirror and Evening News) as having charged the Jesuits of the Philippines of having incited revolution. I have said no such thing and have issued a denial. In the pause after the golf game last Saturday I merely said to Greg Datuin, Han Brown and Noring Andolong that we were looking into the participation or involvement of some of the school authorities including the Jesuits in the disorders and riots of the past several weeks.<br>
Father Ortiz has immediately issued a disclaimer and a charge of fascism and practically demanded an investigation. So I am asking the Secretary of Education, the Secretary of Justice and the Immigration Commissioner to conduct an investigation specially of the Adenauer Fund which is supposed to be used for research for the constitutional convention. Father Sheffeld is pinpointed by Father Doherty as the one sent to approve the expenditure of the Adenauer Fund. He is now teaching German in Ateneo.<br>
But then the story might have been blown up by the radicals in media who would only be too glad to see the clergy embarrassed. And to split the moderates whom they may represent and the government.<br>
However some of the Jesuits are indeed preaching the need of violence like some of the faculty members in the public and private universities like UP, PCC….<br>

The march was supposed to get the support of the people in the streets and houses but it did not. Only a few of the spectators joined. It has ended in some Molotov cocktails thrown at the U.S. Embassy, three men caught with handguns at the Mini Golf, someone caught lobbing a Molotov cocktail in Congress, another bag of Molotov cocktails abandoned at the Finance building, about 30 arrested, 14 in the hospital and one serious with a cracked head.<br>
Father Ortiz’ abusive and arrogant reply to my supposed charge that the Jesuits were formenting the revolution (which I have denied and which is untrue) has brought out the image of the friar who brought about the Revolution of 1896. And the people are saying, the priest talks like a king and the king talks softly like a priest.<br>

So do the buses which are still plying their routes although they also claim 200 of their buses have been damaged (glass windows) by the stone-throwing driver-strikers. Mayor Villegas in the conference I called where the bus owners headed by Tony Herras, de Dios and Manzano and the jeepney drivers headed by their lawyer de Luna and Coms. Enrique Medina of the PSC and Edu of the LTC were present, suggested that the jeepneys be organized into one corporation or one working unit working the routes in Manila so that there will be no temptation for the police of Manila to collect tongs from jeepney drivers for preferred parking places and length of awaiting passengers, etc. Maj. Castillo of the MPD Traffic Division promised to take steps to meet the demands. Com. Medina will conduct in chambers meetings for the increase of rates of both buses and jeepneys.<br>
But as of now the transportation was running.<br>
Atty. de Luna claims the students offered financing to the jeepney drivers for them to join the Protest March yesterday. That must be the Kabataan Makabayan.<br>
Leoncio Co, Kabataan Makabayan Secretary General and his common-in-law wife Erlinda Taruc, niece of Peregrino Taruc, were captured in Bo. Talaga, Capas, Tarlac, last night.<br>
The congressmen (about 15) who visited me are all agreed the peaceful demonstrations are debilitating and the disorders must now be induced into a crisis so that the measures may be taken.<br>

Informant was in the meeting SI is of the KM-KPK (Kilusang Progresibong Kabataan under Brondon Cordero). This is the second plot in 1970.<br>
This is disturbing as the informant was present in the meeting. We are getting a confirmation and at the same time doubling Bongbong’s security. Tomorrow he is swimming at St. Martin’s and Imelda will inaugurate the swimming pool.<br>

If we can conditionally ratify the Phil-Japan Trade and Navigation Agreement we may be able to obtain a 200 million dollar loan from Japan. We should press our claim for the coconut excise tax collected by the U.S. during the Commonwealth and after the war to be used for the support of the Philippines in the amount of $250 million and settle for a loan instead.<br>
With this development on Bongbong I may have to hasten the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
But only if they persist upon the path of violence they have started.<br>
The danger that now confronts the matin must be eradicated for all time. Communism must be rooted out.<br>

He was with Piding Montelibano and Speaker Pro Tempore Jose Aldeguer. Piding says he has talked to IP.

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1135" data-line-end="1147">As I study the situation of the nation I am more and more convinced that my solution to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus and the detention of all communist activists as well as all those who have in any way helped in the cause of communism is the right and the only solution.<br>
So I have asked Sec. Ponce Enrile to prepare the applications for search warrants. He and Gen. Yan were in a conference with me at 4:00 PM with the major service commanders and their intelligence officers.<br>
I am now also convinced that the communists do not have popular support but are buying the participation of many of those who join the demonstration like the 8.000 who were in the last Protest March; but that the newspapers and the media specially the Manila Times and the Manila Chronicle are merely building it up with propaganda and beyond this it is nothing.<br>
Spoke before the UP Vanguard Fraternity on the powers of the President in an emergency and the fact that no group can mount a rebellion but that the subversives can engage in assassination, harassments and sabotage – even massive sabotage but that if this happened, I implied I might suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
Father Pacifico Ortiz, the Ateneo President, saw me at 4:00 AM and kept repeating he is praying for my success as President. I have my misgivings. He is a do-gooder, naive and woolly minded.<br>
He kept wanting to know what my reading was of the student demonstrations. I repeated to him my belief that these demonstrations strengthened the hand of a leader in government like me interested in reforms. But he did not seem to understand that communism as practiced differs from ideological communism; that communism has often discarded doctrine to attain its sole objective and that is power, so that communism may take the side of almost any popular movement to attain its ends; it could be the Moslem movement or the nationalist movement, or the jeepney drivers against mulcting police, or the teachers for higher salaries. He kept talking of social justice and the need to talk of it as he does in his radio commentaries. I informed him I am willing to talk of socialism, even communism but that it was the role of intellectuals too to be honest and present the various sides of every question.<br>
He kept wanting to know of the non-communist conspiracy. Of course I assured him of its existence but that no alien government was involved. And that we would reveal its details in good time.<br>
Communism feeds on such well-meaning but naive men who know nothing of realpolitik.<br>
As the member of Father Ortizes increase in our society, I must accelerate the various programs of reform and social justice (specially of economic development), attend to the media and the intellectuals to keep them on the side of liberal democracy, strengthen the military (I have ordered 2,500 M-16 rifles, 1,000 Beretta Brel. assault rifles and the U.S. govt. under MAP will give us 1,200 M-16’s by April for a total of 4,700 new automatic rifles); but more than this I must keep in mind the lesson learned from the history of communism that it is the timely and judicious use of authority and power when the communists are not yet organized enough to mount a guerrilla type massive attack which alone can save our republic from these communists and anarchists.<br>
Now that I have diagnosed the ailment if the demonstrations become violent this month, I will suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>
We are actually organizing now the members of a counter-subversion center. Initially it is an office under the President’s Office, composed of Johnny Ponce Enrile, Melchor and Kits Tatad, but it will include all offices that has anything to do with counter-subversion.<br>

We set aside $2 million monthly for essentials beginning January, and this was at the old rate. And yet there seems to be scarcity. I have asked Sec. Leo Virata to get together with Greg Licaros to bring in essentials through Namarco which must be reactivated if necessary. Even in the provinces soap and sardines seem to be deficient. If this is not attended to, this could be a cause for disorders. And reports indicate the Chinese are hoarding. The communists could very well be in this too. This bears watching.<br>
Imelda brought the children and the Martel and Kokoy Romualdez families to Pagsanjan, up the rapids under the falls and down again. They apparently enjoyed the trip. Stayed at Malacanang to finish my work and think after reading the book The Strategy of Deception by Jeane J. Kirpatrick, a study in worldwide communist tactics. Her thesis is the alleged inevitable class struggle and victory of the proletarian class has been disproved by history and that Communists in practice are less doctrinaire than expedient. Theirs is realpolitik, less ideology. All they seek, in short is power, no matter what and the liberal democrats should meet them with the same objectivity and reality. The book disproves every single theory of Marx.<br>

<strong>Malacañang</strong><br>
Mar 9, 1970<br>
Monday<br>
11:30 PM<br>
The first case of subversion under RA 1700 has been filed against Leoncio Co caught in Talaga, Capas, Tarlac in a raid of the military. He is the former Sec. Gen. of the Kabataang Makabayan against whom former Huks have testified that he is one of the high ranking officers of the new Communist Party.<br>
I have directed Sec. Ponce Enrile and Gen. Tanabe to get the witnesses against the Kabataang Makabayan leaders who are actually with the Communist Party and prepare the legal cases against them.<br>
We will now shift to the legal phase of the struggle until the communists use violence requiring the use of my extraordinary powers.<br>
At the same time we are now utilizing the propaganda facilities of the government. We will publish a Government Record or Report on our positions on issues that are being distorted by the Manila Times and the Manila Chronicle. This weekly will be distributed to all offices and schools. Johnny Tuvera will edit it.<br>
We are also using TV and radio, harnessing all our friendly commentators.<br>
I have asked O.D. Corpus to organize a think tank of constructive thinkers in the schools on subversion, counter-subversion and liberal democracy.<br>
The military operations in Tarlac are doing very well. Called up Gen. Tanabe to congratulate him and his boys. The nephew of Dante was killed with some others. Others were captured.<br>
I still feel that my greatest contribution to the country will still be saving it from communism. It would be easy to adopt palliatives and delay the confrontation with this deadly peril. But this would be the easy way out. After my term and within the decade or the next the nation would have to confront it anyway. And I would have been guilty of dereliction of duty if not cowardice for not facing up to it and rooting it out while I had the opportunity and the power.<br>
So I am decided that I must risk even the future of my family so as to save our freedoms and individual dignity. The issue has become this simple and brutal. It is a matter of survival. It is a matter of daring or not –on my part. And I decide to dare.<br>

We will replace the Monetary Board Resolution 289 with an export tax of 15% for the raw exports and 10 percent for the processed, these to be reduced every two years until 5% remains for the raw exports and none for the processed.<br>
The floating rate remains until we can determine by June the actual and true rate of the peso.<br>
Met the Anti-communist league which is for stern measures against the demonstrators and file criminal cases against them that will stick. Tony Roxas Chua wanted action against the Chinese Commercial News and the two brothers. Quintin Yuyitung had a case of deportation before but I rescinded the order to deport him.<br>
Met the Laguna mayors and the Cagayan Valley Mountain Provinces congressmen. Had lunch as usual at 2:30 PM.<br>
Have just had two teeth (actually roots left after the tops were broken off when I hurried through a dessert of chocolate with nuts last week) extracted by Dr. Primo Gonzales and Capt. Paz. My mouth still numb. These are the teeth broken or shivered by the Japanese in Fort Santiago 28 years ago and over which caps had been put.<br>

Commander Madrigal confirmed it to our asset at Tarlac.<br>
The KM boys, Barrican, Nelson Navarro and Nilo Tayag are in Bulacan and other provinces drumming up interest in their People’s Congress on the 17th of March. But the interest in the demonstrations is waning and the fever is dying down.<br>
So at the rate we are moving the old schedule of April or June may be kept and not any earlier. This will give us time to prepare even the evidences against the subversives.<br>
We are trying to scrounge for weapons specially M-16’s and ammunition in Vietnam. There are officers there who are willing to give them free to us even at the risk of violating regulations. And sad to state beggars we are and choosers we cannot be. So I have directed 500 M-16’s to be bought at cut rate prices if necessary. I would like at least a million rounds of 223 ammo to go with them.<br>
The ambushes of the Maoists are by M-16’s and M-79’s while most of our boys are still using M-I’s. Dante barely escaped by motorcycle the other day that his nephew who was killed was handcarrying some ammo to him. We have only about 400 M-16’s in the entire AFP.<br>
Have rested today. No exercise and golf because of the teeth extraction. Asked Joe Guevara to include the results of the survey in his column.<br>

The Elizaldes have agreed to allow Kits Tatad my press secretary to write a column correcting the mistakes committed in the morning press specially the Manila Times. When we need to increase the circulation by 20,000 we would need per month 100 tons of newsprint at a cost of $15,000. But we would need three months supply as a standby.<br>
We are also going to do this in radio by Kits and TV by somebody else. Leon O Ty will now also start a TV commentary.<br>
Conferred with the people who have anything to do on prices. Appointed UnderSec. Bung Tanco as the Chairman of the committee to attend to prices. The plan includes importation by consumer cooperatives, tie-up of the agricultural or producer cooperatives and the consumer cooperatives directly or through the GMFTM. This may be the silver lining of this cloud of high prices and hoarding. The Phil. Wholesale Society has been given $200,000 to import essentials.<br>
The importers of prime commodities (canned goods) are willing to give their entire supply to the government for distribution. I give them 5% profit only. The offer was made by the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce and big importers like Connell Bros.<br>

It is a case of private interest against the public good. So there is no choice. And I have ordered CAA Administrator Ablan to give cargo unloading and storage space to both PAN AM and Northwest as well as a fringer in the new terminal each, such to be constructed at their expense. Both promise to spend a million dollars each for the propagation of the tourist routes in the Philippines.<br>
Had lunch with Sen. Diokno, another of those who aspires to be President although he denies it. He told me the oil companies make profits on their crude oil purchases from their mother or affiliate companies setting their own price and on the cost of carriers, the latter about 15 to 20%. At his suggestion I asked Com. E. Medina of the PSC to see to it that after the increase of 5 centavos for jeepney fares, even if gasoline prices should go up as the crude oil inventories of the refineries is only up to April or May, there should be no further increases of passenger fare.<br>
Bung Tanco seems to be doing well as my action officer on prices. But Nanding Lopez wants him to work in the Department of Agriculture now.<br>

So I am taking anti-biotics that always make me feel funny.<br>
Worked on prices again. More dollars for imports ($2 million monthly for essential canned goods and $1.8 for milk). Have ordered the GMFTM to initiate rolling stores and supply commissaries to be put up by public and private corporations. Recombined milk now being produced by factories working at half their capacity will be working a full capacity to fill up 1/2 of requirement – 150,000.<br>
But we must pass the export tax of 15% and 10% so that there will be no speculation on exports, there will be more dollars and there can be a reasonable estimate of costs which cannot be done with the present floating rate.<br>
Same with the price and rent control law.<br>

The Tondo squatters demonstration for today did not go through as I convinced the leaders in Tondo and Manda and the priests with the Council that it is not necessary for we will give the land in the Tondo foreshore to the people who are entitled to it. Manda Elizalde claims he was the one who dissuaded the people and that even Father Murphy was agitating the people to demonstrate. The nuns with whom Imelda talked say this is not true as it was Father Murphy who was dissuading the Tondo people from demonstrating. It is a case where the people are caught between two men who want to get the honors of improving Tondo.<br>

Nacida has increased the exported cottage industry products from $29 million to about $100 since 1965 to 1969 and is the 4th biggest dollar earner. And as one of the visitors to Pampanga has observed it has raised the standard of living of the common people.<br>

I am now studying the proposal of Walter Leny our consultant on oil exploration to adopt an agency form of service contract where concessions remain with the government but are worked on by a service-contractor, all exploration at his expense, who upon discovery of oil acquires the right to buy the oil at 12 1/2 percent less than current price. This gives the government 70% of all the proceeds from the oil concession. This should solve the question of the 1974 termination of parity rights of the American oil companies.<br>

Apparently Sarmiento is lobbying so as to put plywood in a separate category as processed exports and thus since he is the biggest producer of plywood he will earn more profits. I insisted on the bill as it is – an across the board ten percent tax without exceptions. The distribution of the proceeds will be 40% infrastructure, 30% Development Fund and 30% to the General Fund.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1356" data-line-end="1364">Met with the publishers of Manila dailies who also run the TV and Radio stations for breakfast from 8:00 AM to 11:30 AM. This included Chino Roces of Manila Times. He seemed conciliatory although he pointedly asked if I was not pressurizing the press because the movie advertisers led by his cousin Marcos Roces of Ideal Theater have notified him that they are cutting out advertising from the Times beginning tomorrow. Markitos had told me that they were doing so because the Manila Times was encouraging demonstrations which have driven away customers.<br>
Even Chino admitted that a revolution would fail but he claimed that I was underestimating the Communists and he maintained they were 20,000 strong in the Manila area alone and that they would try a revolt in 1970 and 1971 to early 1972 and if they failed then, they would fail completely.<br>
They agreed that any overt act of rebellion or sabotage would justify my suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Chino, claiming to know their plans, said that they plan to blast and burn the gasoline stations, 30 men to each station and destroy the public utilities including the Meralco, Nawasa and telephone. Even Heny Lopez and Andy Soriano asked why the leaders could not be arrested before they tried this and Chino hastened to add that the evidence would not support a case in court.<br>
Chino was apparently trying to frighten the others who asked me about my assessment. I assured them no revolt would not succeed but that the military felt that if there was going to be a military confrontation anyway, it should be triggered as soon as possible so that there may be less casualties.<br>
Andy Soriano said that one of his own men had suggested that San Miguel Brewery cut down on its advertising in Manila Times because of its leftist tendencies. This was to support my position that I had nothing whatsoever to do in suggesting the cut of advertisement although I did say that if this were so it would be a legitimate act against a paper that was becoming uncontrollably leftist. I then recounted how there had been a fight in the printing section of the Manila Times when Kabataang Makabayan changed the stories without the knowledge of the desk.<br>
I took the opportunity to tell them that the Manila Times was netting P400,000 a month and that it was true that we were checking on its income but that the routinary investigations of the business transactions of its shareholders was exactly that – routinary and of no concern of mine.<br>
They agreed to print an article under my by-line – A Primer on Communism. asked them to meet without me to agree on how they can help our democracy which they pledge to protect, then to come to see me with the plan.<br>

With me in retreat are Ramon Cojuangco, Daniel Vasquez, Vincent Recto, Manoling Revilla, Pepe Oledan, Gene Tanseco, Francisco Rabat, Benny Tantoco, Mundy Feliciano, Chito del Castillo, Col. Fabian Ver, Capt. Yoro.<br>
I come into retreat with my prayer that God give me the grace of strength and insight so that I may save my people from suffering; that I may not decide in anger what has to be decided but that I may not hesitate in doubts and irresolution when the decision has to be taken; that I may have the grace of patience and understanding.<br>
Played golf at the Mansion golf course 11:30-1:00 after arrival.<br>
PMA graduation exercises where I predicted that the military confrontation with communism is inevitable. (Incidentally Chino Roces headlines this with “Marcos warns of martial law” in the Manila Times). Last Saturday when I persisted in asking about the information that he has on communist plans, after stating that I underestimate the communist strength and that they would strike this year or next, he asked me to assign a good intelligence officer to go to Hongkong and get the information from Peking contacts giving the impression that the activities of the radicals in the Philippines are planned and orders given from Peking.<br>
Met with Joe and Ralph Friday night. Convinced Joe to update his diary and to then confirm his handwriting when a raid with search warrant seizes his diary with which he is confronted with the others who will also be searched and arrested simultaneously.<br>

Monday<br>
Free Time to 12:00 AM. Father Cruz, our retreat master, says our Christian commitment is to humanize our society. I have been saying this for a long time.<br>
It is both a Christian ideal and a pragmatic requirement of peace and development. For if society is not humanized, we fail to do what is right and worse, we lay the groundwork for the leftist radicals whose siren song will be the total incapability of the democratic society to help the brutalized underprivileged and the need for another ideology.<br>
But to do so requires management, more funds and currency stability as well as the harnessing of both private and public initiatives and resources.<br>
The “Tulungan” project in Tondo is an example. We will create new factories, give away the land to those who are hungry for land, build socialized housing, set up agro-industrial settlements, the green revolution, etc. But we need active executives and funds.<br>
I must now certify the bill on compulsary forced savings of ten percent of declared income which shall be invested in government bonds. Declared income is estimated at P2.7 billion so that this would mean forced savings of P270 million. The businessmen thru Piding Montelibano is willing to increase the rate to raise a total of<br>
P800 million from both the 10% export tax and the forced savings.<br>
The Congress (actually only the Senate as the House has approved both the Export Tax and Price Control Bills) has agreed upon my instance to meet on Holy Week (Monday to Wednesday) for the first time in history. They have consumed 48 days of their 100 days session and have passed only five bills on second reading.<br>
4:00 PM<br>
“Filters” and a corner of one’s self that is not “slave to your appetites” or subject to pressures and where one is moved for goodness only for goodness sake – not because of any reward or consideration<br>
The Lord supports you – be not afraid. This is the idea of telling the leader – go and expose yourself to the anger of the mob. Here I touch you and make you strong – go and do good. Bring my message and you shall succeed.<br>
The “filters” the good father speaks of are experiences that determine the manner with which one looks at things. One should not allow them to govern one’s decisions.<br>
“He who does not have the habit of reflection surrenders himself to panic” from the French philosopher.<br>
This is plain objectivity, scholarliness and freedom from passion and bias.<br>
So God invites us to help him tend his flock. What shall be our response.<br>
Have hope. There is a natural goodness in everyone that will conquer evil. So how shall we respond to the invitation of God.<br>
85% of our people quietly works for our progress. The quiet anonymous government employee who spent what he called an overpayment to him, in seeds which he taught the underprivileged of Sapang Palay to plant and tend; the young men who have started small garlic farms and exported them; I can add those who are helping themselves by building irrigation dams on their own free labor – these are our people who believe in our democratic wav of life. But these 85% are now in a state of tension. So they seek guidance. And we must give it to them. For by creating new jobs, by increasing the income of the poor, by furnishing the social services, we remove the people from evil. Thus we do God’s bidding. Thus we fulfill our Christian commitment in our society that is under tension.<br>
The forces of the leftist radicals are equally dedicated. One Huk before he died said the principles of love for the poor and justice are but doctrines to you (talking to Father Cruz), to us they are our life.<br>
So our task needs the same courage that was needed in Bataan.<br>
The lecture of Father Cruz was so inspiring and timely that we invited the girls to come tomorrow to hear him but they have their own retreat under Fathers Tanseco and Nebrida. So we are tape recording our respective lectures instead for replay later on.<br>
Father Unson’s opening lecture was how to approach a retreat which is nothing but a new experience of God. I myself feel it is a renewal of my conversations with my Maker. He (Father Unson) sets three basic prerequisites. They are:<br>
N- earness – to God<br>
0-peness – to any message he may send<br>
W-onder at the pleasant result<br>

Tuesday<br>
Third day of retreat<br>
The meditations have been inspirational. “The Lord went into the darkness of the forest for his own test” was the theme of meditation this morning at 7:30 AM. I exercised and jogged inside the room for ten minutes (jogging); all in all about 15 minutes. It did not feel cold after that unlike yesterday morning when I did not exercise and felt chilly. Last night I was chilly and woke up at 4:30 AM.<br>
It is my feeling that Father Jose Cruz the retreat master must think I might be breaking down under the pressures of the crisis and so the inspirational talks. I must thank him for it. He even spoke of the Manila Times slanting the headline yesterday “Marcos warns of martial law” which of course I did not as borne out by the body of the<br>
story. Neither did Manila Chronicle help. It carried the headline “Marcos Threatens Martial Law” which was worse.<br>
“Goodness may not be immediately appreciated but this is the test. History is a capricious mistress and does not guarantee that even if she allows you a historical role she will reserve even but a little space for you. But it is for one’s satisfaction that one does what is right even if unpopular. One small mistake and all the brilliant achievements in the past are forgotten.” His example – Rizal.<br>
And I say we do what is right because of self-respect and integrity. Although a sense of history may propel us to do so, this is not the primary motivation, but pride in one’s integrity and in one’s self is a greater cause at times. Let me stand this suffering but Iet it be a suffering that will cure. Let it be the passion that will bring life.<br>
For the cries of the evil ones are heard over the land. And I must often bear the lash of their tongues in silence even if I know they are wrong.<br>
For time will bear me out. Of this I am sure as I am sure that my conscience tells me so.<br>
Today it is fashionable to be aligned against the establishment and I symbolize it. So all kinds of men pick up the cry of protest against what could be actual causes of grievance like crookedness and pettiness in public service.<br>
We listen to them knowing that the accusers are not any less guilty nor are they so nobly motivated. For there are indeed valid grounds for grievance and there are indeed rapacious, vicious and indolent men in the public service. And we must also rectify errors committed in the past.<br>
But the past is a heavy legacy of all these ills – 400 years and more of apathy, indolence, viciousness, pettiness and indifference. Four hundred years the spirit had died –and now suddenly we must resuscitate it. Phoenix-like it must spring alive from the ashes of our frustrations and our failures. This miracle is my task. Or at least its beginning and birth is.<br>
So I pray that I may be given the grace of inspiration, of wisdom, discrimination, dedication and courage to accomplish this task.<br>
And I am strengthened as I hear the Lord say: Fear not. I am with you. You shall not fail. For you bear my words in your mouth and my courage in your heart.<br>
Now I know why I could not order the shooting of the men who attacked Gate 4 of Malacañang on January 30th. They had attempted to burn the Medical Clinic, they had actually burned the fire truck with which the gate was rammed open as well as several vehicles and they had entered the compound where actually six were arrested.<br>
But there flashed through my mind’s eye all the killings and the butchery that I had known and I had participated in what was legitimate combat and I recoiled at the memory of what may be useless waste of life.<br>
The danger was there but it was not the danger that I had known in many a battle and paled into insignificance before the desperation of the last war and the underground.<br>
And most of the attackers were irresponsible children who could have been our children.<br>
I was never born to massacre babies.<br>
However our military and some of the advisers say if an armed conflict as you say is inevitable why not provoke it now when we would have to kill less than later when the communists will be stronger and we would have to kill more of our own people.<br>
Because it is still my hope that by legal action of the courts and restrained action against those engaged in actual violence we shall so weaken them and render them leaderless and debilitated they will never be able to mount an armed uprising.<br>
And also because we must stabilize the currency and propel the economy forward with such momentum that no matter what the jolts, the quakes and the shocks, later on such inertia will carry our country forward inexorably.<br>
Father Jose Cruz seems to have studied the problem of the militant youth although he claims that his views are merely those of an ordinary citizen.<br>
He starts with the warning that the problem may not be as insurmountable or as serious as most people may think. Only 350 armed Huks, a base of legal cadres (he calls them part time fighters at night) of a thousand and a half and some mass base. But he says 85% of our people are quiet workers for our progress although they receive only 40% of the benefits derived from our development while the 15% that owns the greater portion of our wealth receive the 60% of such growth fruits. He feels that we must not allow the communists (he calls them the leftists) to win the 85% and they have not. For he feels that the wisdom and discrimination of this 85% of our people sees through the slogans of the leftists, “imperialism, fascism, feudalism.”<br>
“In lieu of slogans we must give them issues and a dynamic ideology that is relevant to their lives. This dynamic Christian ideology that has to do with anything that is human. For it is through humanity that one approaches God.”<br>
And the greater number look askance at the violence and the disorder formented by the radicals for it destroys all that they have been working for. But this 85% is under tension and gropes for answers which we must furnish them. Thus the courageous dedicated leadership that will guide and reassure.<br>

Last night we had a second joint retreat with our retreat masters talking to us in succession. We had invited them to dinner at the Mansion then to another session. Father Cruz talked on filters and the Christian’s commitment in Philippine society. Father Tanseco followed on counsel for the married – the differences of outlook between the man and woman. The woman seeks to build a home so she is obsessed with a home life. But the man also wants a work life. The man is passionate and his love is in spurts but the woman is romantic, needs the refinements of preparation for the sexual act and has a love that is more consistent and prolonged and may be too possessive. Father Nebrida who is a Basque, a friend and colleague of the Black Pope and may become the next Black Pope spoke of the need to consider each human being as the nearest approach to God and therefore must be treated as such,<br>
The common note was hope and not despair, life and not death and the triumph of goodness in man over evil – this struggle being the most agonizing of conflicts.<br>
Blas Ople warns of a plot to take over the government by some retirees being openly spoken of in media circles. He says that Thursday or Friday students armed by the Huks or the CIA will attack the police and Metrocom, place me under House arrest in Baguio, the first division to neutralize any loyal troops of the AFP. So I sent Gen. Zagala to take over command of the 1st Infantry Division, grounded Col. Carreon, deputy commander and an S. Osmena man, as well as Commodore Cabal and Col. Irlanda, Commander and Deputy of the SOWESCOM as well as Col. Dizon, CO of the 20th BCT, and Capt. Nangkil, the S-2 of the 10th BCT stationed in Central Luzon.<br>
Gen. Zagala has taken back command of the Tabak Division, transferred command of the Pasig Task Force to Col. Jose, Deputy Commander of PHILCAG. The Deputy Commander of Gen. Rancudo, CG of the 5th Fighter Wing (jet fighters), Col. Bauzon was replaced by Col Bueno.<br>
Class ’44 of PMA will be retired except for some who are vouched for by the loyal commanders.<br>
So everything is under control. But I guess that this is a false alarm. However as Gen. Espino, Vice Chief of Staff who was here on the way to inspect Batanes, says, there is nothing lost in precaution. He commands the reserves of nine batallions in the contingency plan.<br>
Chino Roces saw Sec. Alex Melchor last night and says he is willing to sell the Manila Times. He is probably feeling the pressure and may think that he is going to be arrested next. I do not believe him but we will play along. I am sending Ronnie Velasco, who has suggested to Bebeng Roces to put up an anti-communist newspaper with the Manila Times outlets, to see Don Ramon Roces if the stockholders (Ramon Roces actually organized the Manila Times after the war and gave shares free to the Roces family) will sell out. Then I meet Chino Saturday here in Baguio.<br>
I go to Ilocos Norte, lunch at Poro Point and return to Baguio tomorrow if I do not go to Manila for lunch.<br>

Talked to Moon Park of Phil-Asia on the possibility of his extending financing for the establishment of Trading Centers for tobacco in the north, grading the tobacco (Virginia) for export and thus developing our export industry, cutting out the anomalies in the trading of Virginia tobacco specially in the grading, the ultimate withdrawal of subsidy to tobacco (in three years I hope) as well as his company financing the purchases of Virginia tobacco by PVTA.

The greens are lush but we cannot cut the grass too short as there is lack of water and some of them are shaded.<br>

The day started with Chino Roces and Enriquito Zobel. Chino came to say that he was for the success of my administration and that his paper would help. He also pumped me for information. “Are you decided to arrest them?” he inquired. I said yes but I must settle the economic questions of the stability of the currency, the legislative program and the social welfare program first. And there must be an overt act. Enriquito said “But not too late, Mr. President.” Not much advance from the last meeting.<br>
I ordered the final draft of the contract for the private buyers to put up the P100 million for the Trading Centers of Virginia tobacco, to change the classifiers and graders with those coming from the buyers, and to convert the liability that is Virginia tobacco now into an asset by making it an export product. Had Moreno, Mapa and Congs. Crisologo and Valdez in the conference. Told Sen. Pres. Puyat about it.<br>

Easter Sunday hunt for the children at the bowl and pergola. Irene and Imee got the big eggs worth P50. The bunnies are worth P15 and the eggs P2.00. There were at least twenty five children of all types of friends.<br>
Imee and Irene left with some of the children for Manila after the mass as they have a lot of homework to do although there are no classes tomorrow.<br>
Lunch with the other half of the 5th Fighter Wing jet fighter pilots.<br>
Then a nap from 2-3 PM although I could not sleep well and golf from 3 to 6 – 18 holes.<br>
The Manila Chronicle has come out this Sunday with a vicious front page editorial on Martial Law which included a cartoon of the country tied up captive with all the rats representing the ills of the country and the sword of Damocles Martial Law over his head.<br>
It sounded like an Ernie Granada or IP Soliongco editorial. They must be agitated by the fear of arrest if I suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>

Got the senate moving on the export tax. It seems they want to classify exports into processed, semi-processed and not processed on the basis of the UN classification on the basis of 12%, 10% and 4%. We hold a caucus tomorrow.<br>
Met with ASAC and kept it under my office. San Salientes and Gen. Balao as well as Com. Sychongco.<br>

Met with VP Lopez, Maceda, Mapa and later Cruz as well as Bung Tanco to organize the Price Control Council with the VP as Chairman. Maceda as Vice Chairman and the Department of Commerce and Industry furnishing the secretariat.<br>
I am most interested in organizing cooperatives in every town to tie up with the APC, ACA and the PACD – as well as the consumers’ cooperatives and the GMFTM. This will answer the problem of prices and the middlemen.<br>

And I am held liable for this. In the breakfast with Sen. Aytona and Cong. Jose Alberto, chairmen of the Senate and House Ways and Means, I asked that the Congress now assume responsibility for their expenses. And I asked the inclusion of contingency funds in the unprogrammed budget for any eventuality. The areas of contingency would be AFP, National Emergency Plans, Natural Calamities, Health, Labor. Information would be included in National Emergency Plans. I convinced them of the danger by calling attention to the training camps of subversives in their areas.</p>

Poor Ronnie Velasco waited since 5:00 PM to play with me.<br>
Came from Tuguegarao where I spent the whole morning. Left at 8:00 AM and arrived at the NAB at 2:15 after a one hour flight. The reception was tumultuous and the people scratched my hands in an effort to shake hands with me. Felt like the campaign all over again but of course that was the north.<br>
I explained the need to spend the new special fund of P10 million (P3.5 m of which goes to Cagayan Valley as Ex-Sen. Ganzon had insisted in dividing the lump sum with the Visayas and Mindanao which do not produce tobacco – Ganzon had grown overbearing and erascible and so lost in the last elections) properly so we can increase our exports of native tobacco as we are converting Virginia tobacco into an export crop.<br>
We must also put up a cigar-rolling factory in the Cagayan Valley. The Valley is rich and it has the longest cement road and the biggest number of long bridges in the Philippines.<br>
I signed the Price Control Bill into law at 3:00 PM.<br>
But we must pass the export tax bill so as to stabilize the currency and the prices. Joe Roy and Diokno are against it so I must confer with them tomorrow. Wonder what their game is.<br>
Imelda is at the Cultural Center attending the presentation of the Warsaw Philharmonic and giving them a reception afterwards. She laughingly said that she will be with the leftists tonight.<br>
I have found a place where Bongbong can go hunting. This is the hacienda of Luis Gonzales, one half of which has been bought by Cong. David Puzon. There is a lake full of ducks and to the east he can hunt deer and wild pig on a drive blind. Incidentally the Gonzales Hacienda of 3,000 hectares is near the Madrigal hacienda which are both at Luwain, Kalinga-Apayao. We pass it by helicopter on the way from Isabela to Tabuk. But Bongbong will have to watch out for malaria.<br>
Joe Maristela says it may be difficult for him to testify against the group of Terry Adevoso. He suggests that they be handled in a more peaceful way so that they may not continue with their plan of assassination.<br>
VPres. Lopez has just rejected my offer for him to be chairman of the Price Control Council. This seems to jibe with the boast of the plotters that they are in touch with him and the editorials of the Chronicle have given substance to my fears that the Lopezes are in on the plot to assassinate me.<br>

Have just finished a charming dinner for Prince Bernhard of the Netherlands; he pilots his own plane and is head of the World Wildlife Conservation of which Gen. Lindbergh is a director.<br>
Have finished my paper work including the appointment of Ex-Sec. Manuel Lim as Chairman of the Price Control Council in lieu of VPres. Lopez who has rejected it because he may not have time for it. I can start tomorrow after the breakfast for the Military Advisers to Seato and a courtesy call of the President of Pepsi Cola, Mr. Kendall. I go to Ozamis City where I have Imelda to go by helicopter to Mahayag, Zamboanga del Sur to inaugurate a 10,000 hectare irrigation system built on a self-help basis at a cost to government of only P40,000; back to Ozamis to close the PRISSA; go to Iligan by helicopter to Iligan City to meet the religious and political leaders then by boat to Surigao overnight; open the Interscholastic meet, then by boat overnight to Cagayan de Oro, inaugurate the extended airfield, then proceed to Zurallah and by helicopter the Lake Sebu area of the Tagabilis and the Obos, then after lunch and conference to General Santos by plane to sleep at Dole Phil.<br>
And on Monday the Pinagbuklod Ng Manggagawang Filipino decided to stay away from their jobs to pray for the increase of the minimum wage. The papers of course call it a strike.<br>
Father Blanco in a visit to Alex Melchor alleged that the laborers and students are planning to blast the fuel tanks of the oil companies if the gasoline price is increased (which it has already).<br>
I feel that this particular Jesuit is trying to earn a reputation as a violent radical -just for the notoriety and the publicity.<br>
But if there is any massive sabotage I will have to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus.<br>

Actually I write this on April 5 at 9:00 AM off the coast of Surigao, Surigao on board the President 777 while we are waiting for the people to assemble at the wharf for the reception. I siept without writing my daily notes as I was fatigued. I had not slept (practically) the night before and had been running from the 7:30 AM breakfast with the Military Advisers of Seato including our old friends Admiral McCain who commanded one of the submarines that supplied us in the guerilla movement during the war while the Japanese occupied the Philippines and Air Marshall and Mr. Dawee of Thailand. Met with Mr. Kendall of Pepsi Cola bought by Cong. Bert Sabido and father. He is close to Pres. Nixon so I conveyed through him the message that they should not commit the same mistake they committed in Korea – that is the failure to arm and train indigenous troops while there was time. The U.S. would come to protect their bases if the communists took over so why not just make the AFP stronger now.<br>
The Fokker Friendship is out of commission because of lack of some spare parts which have to be flown from Amsterdam. So I used the PNB King Air and Imelda used a PAL chartered AVRO.<br>
Helicoptered against a 40 knot wind (in 25 minutes) to Mahayag for the inauguration of the Salug Valley Irrigation Dam for 11,000 hectares. Then back to heli to Molave (both at Zamboanga de Sur) and participated in the fiesta. Returned to Ozamis City to close the PRISSA (Private Schools Athletic Association national competition College and High Schools) then by boat to Iligan to exhort the Ulamalis religion.<br>

Am writing this at 11:20 PM, April 7th, as we have been rather busy.<br>
Overnight from Surigao, Surigao which we left at about 8:00 PM to arrive at Cagayan de Oro at about 8:00 AM on the 6th. Inaugurated the only two-kilometer cemented airfield in Mindanao. Laoag is not cemented and is only presently 1,800 meters only but I am extending it. I could see Sen. Pelaez titillated when I said that of the triumvirate (Macapagal, Pelaez, Marcos) of bar topnatchers in the Congress of 1949 only Pelaez has not become President.<br>
Flew by Fokker, Imelda using an Avro chartered from PAL to Zurallah in Allah Valley where we had lunch after a tumultuous welcome of all the mayors of Cotabato del Sur, Gov. Morales and Cong. Chiongbian. Had Ali Dimaporo and Floring Crisologo with us. Flew by Huey Helicopters at 1:30 PM to Bo. Comatok (a 15 minute flight including flying around) where the PANAMIN project is for the Tagabili, Obo or Manobo and the Blaan’s or Bilaans. I proclaimed a 5,000 hectare reservation for them and without prejudice to existing rights of grazing land leases and homesteaders.<br>
Then flew at 4:00 PM to the Lake Sebu area where there has been some bloodshed and burning of villages because of land conflicts.<br>
At 5:00 helicoptered to Dole Phil. where we are now staying with the Velascos. Ronnie who met us in Zurallah is President of Dole Phil.<br>
Had time for four holes of golf, two with the aid of a flashlight. Dave Gores, the plantation superintendent, was my caddy. South Cotabato Press &amp; Radio Interview. Slept at 12:00. Woke up 9:50.<br>

International and MIA facilities for air navigation damaged. Temporary systems established.<br>
Alex Melchor and Johnny Ponce Enrile apparently taking care of things very well.<br>
Imelda cooked crab in banana leaves with garlic and ginger for dinner.<br>
Talked to the children by the Dole wireless system through a phone patch at 2:00 PM and again at about 8:30 PM. Irene was more concerned about Pugger their Pekinese than about anything else. They were evacuated to Pangarap. Only one 10 inch vase Sang de berg of Imelda at the reception hall crashed. Parts of the chandeliers fell and Malacanang has some more cracks.<br>
Dinner and reminiscences of criminal practice and Yamashita’s treasure and the war up to 11:00 PM with Ronnie and Linda and Paul and Phyllis Sink.<br>

Went to bed at 12:30 last night and woke up at 5:30 AM. Heli to the coffee plantation at the knoll which is about 3,000 feet less high. The housing site of Dolephil is 2,100 feet above sea level. Unusually warm but a continuing 15 knot breeze from the east.<br>
Took off for Davao at 7:30 AM. Davao City at 8:00 AM. No hostile demonstrators. To the conference of bishops where Mons. Gonzaga and Velasco were present. Then to the inauguration of two city cemented streets. People very enthusiastically waving to us and shaking hands, running out of their homes to see us.<br>
Took off for Manila at 9:30 AM. Uneventful trip but ceiling high. Estimated 15,000 feet. Landed at 11:50 AM. Inspected the temporary tower (navigational lent by the 13th Air Force as our MIA tower was knocked out by the earthquake). Then to the Pedro Guevara School that collapsed. Built by the city and inaugurated only last February. Faulty construction – powdery cement. Covered by television-radio. Went to the top of the debris with the volunteer workers.<br>
Bongbong says he never knew he could run so fast downstairs. He first fell flat on the floor of his room and then ran out. So with Irene but she returned to pick up Pugger the Pekinese who was sour because he had been awakened.<br>

Just played golf with Bobby and massage. Then a briefing by Col. Ver on the Adevoso plot on a coup d’etat. All team leaders for the kidnapping or assassination of Maceda, Raval, Ablan, Crisologo identified. But that for me as yet remains unknown to our asset Col. Jose Maristela. Adevoso may be replaced by Gen. Sanchez as the leader of the operation. And there will be a big nation-wide rally on June 19th where they will have killer, looter and stealer as well as arson groups. Loot will be distributed to the squatters in Tondo.<br>
But what surprised our asset was that Jimmy Propongco brought him to the VIP Bldg. where the others – Daza, Sanchez, etc. except Adevoso were and in a few minutes Osmeña came into the room and asked to be briefed on the progress of the respective conspirators. Osmeña is quoted as saying that Byroade is sympathetic. Salonga is supposed to be in the know.<br>
This places a new and dangerous aspect to the plot. Because for the first time, Osmeña is confirmed as the mastermind and the financier of the plot. We must know the men assigned to assassinate me. And the other participants of the plot. But we must be quiet until it is necessary to move.<br>
Went to Bataan by 777 after receiving the UN Secretary General at 7:00 A.M. He stays with us as our official guest. Returned at 1:00 PM to arrive at 4:30 PM.<br>
Met labor leaders on the minimum wage at 5:00 PM. Will meet the chamber leaders tomorrow morning. Then a joint meeting of the congressional leaders and labor leaders on Monday with me.<br>

Have just met with Minister Adam Malik of Indonesia after the state dinner for US Sec. Gen. U Thant. Foreign Minister Rajaratman of Singapore also here.<br>
Warned him of Osmeña and his partner Larry Truckman who has a lurid past of gun running and selling in South America.<br>
Postponed trip of Pres. Suharto to the Philippines because of the Maoist plot to embarrass him and me from May to latter part of this year.<br>
Discussed the Cambodian question. He feels the ICC should be brought and backed to drive away the Vietcongs so that Cambodia can be neutral.<br>
U Thant was able to address the joint session of Congress where he was cheered not only by the members but by the picketers for a higher minimum wage.<br>
But he may be embarrassed in the UP as 200 graduates have anticipated their desire to stand up and leave if he addresses the graduation. So there will be a private ceremony in the President’s office of the UP<br>
We certainly have come down to a new low in international stature.<br>
And we will have to do something about this when I have finished with the economic questions of Circular 289, the export tax and minimum wage.<br>
Met with Joe Maristela whom I must introduce to Johnny so we can prepare the legal aspects of the case of plotting a coup d’etat. We will infiltrate the plotters with our men from the PGB or PS. And prepare alternative plans.<br>

Have just finished the state dinner for the One Asia Assembly delegates. Pleasant evening.<br>
Spoke before them this morning on the New Directions for Asia; that “unless by One Asia we mean a Communist Asia, exported war is a reality. And for some time to come, exported war will be the most awesome obstacle to unity in Asia.” “We must create a situation in Asia where the condemnable acts of any superpower will be met by such a general censure by the small nations that the superpowers cannot disregard it.”… “How can you computerize the Asian spirit and place the Asian soul on the scales of the<br>
material world?”<br>
Then met the jeepney drivers headed by Pelagio Villegas and Atty. Lazaro. I will induct their officers on Monday before the conferences on the minimum wage of the congressional, industrial and labor leaders. They still insist on the lowering of the gasoline prices. But I have ordered the Public Service Commission to cancel the certificates of public convenience of jeepney operators who increase their boundary limits thus depriving the jeepney drivers of their share in the increase in rates.<br>
Have started issuing titles to the slum dwellers of the Tondo foreshore land. Settled their conflicts, rerouted the Roxas Boulevard so as not to go through the mass of houses; and directed that the large tracts of land not needed by the such recipients like Don Bosco. The radicals cannot exploit the Tondo slums now. Manglapus is however trying to incite a demonstration which I have been able to prevent.<br>

Pangarap<br>
An earthquake of Intensity V has forced us to transfer quarters temporarily to Pangarap, our one strong clubhouse or resthouse at the Malacañang Park at the other side of the Pasig. Papers in possession of the Romualdezes indicate that Malacañang Park used to belong to the Romualdezes.<br>
Have just introduced Sec. Juan Ponce Enrile to Ex-Col. Jose Maristela in the Osmeña-Adevoso plot to assassinate me and take over the government. Cut-off will be Eric Nubla between them and with Col. Ver.<br>
We have just apprehended another of Commander Dante’s killers in the suburbs. But the priests and nuns keep inciting the people of Tondo to demonstrate and the jeepney drivers to strike. Some nuns have even coerced the jeepney drivers threatening bodily harm, according to Atty. Lazaro and Pelagio Villegas, their leaders. A little unbelievable but they swear it is true as now the priests and nuns are using goons. Where has our pious church come to!<br>
I have ordered Sec. O.D. Corpus of Education to terminate classes after Tuesday because of the possible tragedies that may come out of a recurrence of earthquakes with the children in such school buildings like Pedro Guevara School that collapsed. The roof of the Manila High School collapsed today.<br>
Imelda cooked some ginataan na langka and ginataan na manok and curry for dinner. We asked Father Bautista the PG chaplain, Sec. Ponce Enrile and Neling Nieto to stay for dinner.<br>
The children seem to like it better in this small house – better than the palace anyway.<br>
If the Osmeña-Adevoso plot (although now Adevoso who is supposed to have said that I seem to be doing alright and “perhaps we should join him” meaning me, according to Ex-Col. Jose Maristela, is being pushed out of leadership by Ex-Gen. George Sanchez) continues, I may be compelled to suspend the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. Their plan apparently is to burn Manila on Independence Day, loot and kill in a big (100,000 according to Osmeña) demonstration on Independence Day, June 12, 1970. Although according to Joe Maristela there was a disagreement between Col. Faustino David (Ex-Nica) and Osmeña as to the date, Osmeña saying it was supposed to be on July and David correcting him saying it was supposed to be June.<br>
There were also more Lyceum students among the student demonstrators in UP than UP students, on graduation day (yesterday when U Thant was supposed to address them).<br>
Our people are beginning to feel restive and suggestions keep pouring in that we should do something about communism in the U.P.<br>
But we should not stampede into drastic repression. We must still wait for any massive destruction or violence.<br>
As the situation is today:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1733" data-line-end="1734">A New Communist Party (this are the Maoists) chairman of whom is an Amado Guerrero, the alleged nom de guerre of Jose Maria Sison, Arthur Garcia (reported by Gen. Tanabe killed sometime on the 7th by men of Commander Dante) and the leaders of Kabataang Makabayan. Military head is of course Commander Dante with about 300 armed men.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1734" data-line-end="1735">The Old Communist Party Politburo known as the Traditionalists, inactive but now pressed into organizing their own armed bands with Commander Sumulong as the nucleus. He has about 150 armed men. But he is more Mafia than ideologue and has refused to follow their leadership.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1735" data-line-end="1736">The front organizations for the communists:</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1736" data-line-end="1737">Kabataan Makabayan and its own front organizations SDK</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1737" data-line-end="1738">The Masaka with Felixberto Olalia as leader although he lost to in an election.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1738" data-line-end="1739">The Socialist Party in the Philippines under Lacsina</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1739" data-line-end="1742">The fellow travelers:<br>
a. The Media people<br>
b. The faculty and studentry of some universities</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1742" data-line-end="1743">The worst groups are the political adventurers:</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1743" data-line-end="1744">Osmeña and Adevoso</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1744" data-line-end="1746">Manglapus and the Christian Socialist Movement. To this group may belong such ambivalent do gooders like Fathers Ortiz and Blanco.<br>
The evidence of the plots to overthrow the government indicate:</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1746" data-line-end="1747">A full-blown communist plot with various liquidation squads active in Central Luzon and Manila and backed by an organized dedicated armed force.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1747" data-line-end="1755">The plot in the planning stage to take over the government by Osmeña. This includes the taking alive of Sec. Maceda and Ex-Gen. Raval supposedly to testify in and substantiate the protest of Osmeña after I have been assassinated with Congressman Ablan (Col. Faustino David assigned as team leader), Congressman Crisologo (assigned is Jimmy Piopongco now on a mission to the U.S. either to get financial or armament backing), Cong. Durano (Mayor Bores, Bacals, Nic Tumulak and brother assigned), Cong. Alberto (Col. Juan Daza assigned), Congressman Ali Dimaporo (Rascid Lucman assigned) and others.<br>
In the last meeting at the VIP office of Osmeña where he was briefed, he spoke of a plan to burn Manila on June or July, Terry Adevoso was absent.<br>
This group has put up a training ground in Samar and Iloilo for 300 men each. They claim to have 12,000 firearms not yet smuggled into the country.<br>
They are apparently in touch with the communists as in the establishment of the training grounds they have been using and dropping the name of Commander Dante freely. And they have been seen in touch with both communist and student activists.<br>
But as Adevoso explained in one of their meetings, they must take over the government ahead of the communists or if later they must be able to dislodge such communists without too much trouble.<br>
They have done away with the original plan of a bloody revolution as messy in favor of a neat semi-legal coup d’etat.<br>
Col. Jose Maristela who has sat in all their meetings confirm these facts. So does de Leon, our asset who has infiltrated the Samar Training Camp and Father Laua, the rector of San Agustin University (Iloilo) and his men, as well as Valdellon who insists the Liberal leaders including Salonga and Lucman plotted in the house of Gerry Roxas sometime on February 5, 1970.<br>
Now comes the plan to burn Manila in a big demonstration in June or July,</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="1755" data-line-end="1766">The Manglapus-clerico plot to bring about a revolutionary situation which will force the government to capitulate to his Christian Socialist Movement in the coming elections for the Constitutional Convention and in the subsequent national elections of 1973.<br>
Any kind of deterioration of the economy or erosion of the people’s faith in the government and its leaders is supposed to help their plan. So they finance, support and encourage demonstrations, strikes, violence, anarchy and even assassination.<br>
It is their feeling that the Maoists and radicals or even the communists like Dante and Sumulong are paving the way for them.<br>
Some well-to-do families and oligarchs like the Lopezes and the Zobels may be partially financing them as insurance or for any of their known or unknown reasons.<br>
The various plotters and groups are trying to use each other for their own selfish purposes resulting in a kaleidoscope of plot and counter-plot that defied clarification but is just now beginning to fuse into one grand design.<br>
When the government takes action, it must be able to liquidate not only one or several of the plots but ALL of them with one clean blow.<br>
For the danger or crisis may not come during my administration but may explode in the face of a newly-inducted and therefore disoriented and unprepared neophyte in the Presidency who may stampede and run leaving our country and people to their devices. Then there will be anarchy. And the Armed Forces would take over.<br>
Before the government moves on this front, it must settle the problems in the economic front, in the meantime reorienting its intelligence organization and activities. will now put up an integrated intelligence set-up.<br>
It must exert the utmost pressure on the armed elements in Central Luzon preventing them from supporting the activities of the plotters in Manila. The communists (Maoists and Traditionalists) should be encouraged to fight each other. Sumulong should be further motivated to go after Dante and his men.<br>
We must sow dissension among the activists.<br>
We must move faster on reforms – economic, social and political – specially.</li>

Besa Shoes asking for loans because of the fire.<br>
Mayor, VM and Councilors of Parang, Cotabato the center of smuggling in Southern Mindanao. The Bongo Island Sowescom detachment is not doing its job.<br>
Met Gen. Ne Ulin, Chairman of the Revolutionary Council of Burma since 1962. It is rumored that a coup d’etat is being executed against him tomorrow.<br>
He must be confident though, to leave Burma with Mrs. Ne Ulin for Tokyo, Osaka and London – Osaka for Burma National Day on the 17th at Expo ’70 and London for medical treatment.<br>
The general was garrulous but nervous. He made a running account of everything with little prodding on my part. He impresses me as a forceful man – even rough and ruthless. He speaks easily of killing. Trained by the Japanese in Hainan Island but he wanted to be a doctor.<br>
He was a student leader against the British.<br>
He has controlled insurgency in Burma. There are two groups of insurgents, according to him – the communist (Maoist and Russian oriented) and those organized by the British and the Americans.<br>
He has nine children, six by his first wife and three by his previous wife.<br>
He was close to the Chinese leaders, Chou En Lai, Lao Tsi, until the 1967 Chinese students killing of the Burmese.<br>
Last December the students also had a demonstration in Rangoon. He wanted to know their leaders, so he allowed it, then arrested the leaders. Since then there have been no demonstrations.<br>
In 1948 when Burma acquired independence, the Burmese government were in control only of Rangoon and one or two big towns without any link by land. Communication only by air, but they reduced the communist stronghold village by village.<br>
The situation in Laos and Cambodia is uncertain. Sihanouk may still make a comeback with the help of the communist troops thereat, but that would not be good implying that Sihanouk would be captive.<br>
The big powers always want to come back to a position of dominance. Mrs. Ne Win interjected during the conversation that the Burmese government is a dictatorship and Imelda hastily referred to the many suggestions that this was best for a developing country.<br>
Laos. Cambodia and Vietnam are all small, weak and unstable countries.<br>
Ne Ulin is tall for an Asian, about 5 feet ten inches, balding and seems filled with nervous energy. He has Chinese features but is browner than yellow. He did not finish his medical course although he says he wanted to be a doctor. He was taken by the Japanese for military training and ended up as Chief of Staff of the Burmese Army. He is about sixty years old<br>
All the Manila Times columnists attacked my speech before the One Asia Assembly. Ernesto Granada of the Chronicle as usual was vicious calling it a comic relief. Even Joe Guevara and Doroy Valencia as well as J.V. Cruz criticized it. Joe Guevara said that my foreign policy speeches are below the par of my domestic speeches which are below par. I hope he plays golf some time so he may know what sub par means.<br>
But my impression is that none of them have bothered to read my speech. The Manila Times columnists apparently were guided by the hand of Chino Roces, their publisher. And the Chronicle as well as its prime columnist Granada moved by a general principle of hatred.<br>

a. Revealing the letters of Dante and Sumulong against each other and the acts of one band against the other.<br>
The same among the activists<br>
a. Jose Maria Sison against Dante<br>
b. Nilo Tayag plotting against Dante<br>

I have just come from Rizal Stadium where I opened the Asian Football Youth Tournament. There are 16 competing teams and the Tunku Abdul Raman cup is at stake. Our team tied with Laos in a fast paced game that saw the Laotians ahead at 2-1 at 4 minutes to the end of the last half then a Phil. goal in two minutes and on to a tie.<br>
There was an Intensity IV earthquake on the second game of Korea vs. Thailand, the two roughest teams in the tournament as Bongbong calls them. Korea won on a disqualification of the team for alleged Thai malicious fouls.<br>
Signed the proclamation on the Magalang Agricultural Community Development project this morning. It sets aside 756 hectares for development by the Filipinas Foundation of Enrique Zobel.<br>
Incidentally, he (Enrique) told me that Maceda when removed as Executive Secretary handed over to Ninoy Aquino two duffel bags of documents – according to Ninoy. Since Ninoy is a “congenital liar” this is untrue. And what has Maceda or anyone to reveal. But Ninoy claims he has photostats but that Ablan Junior got back the duffel bags when Maceda was appointed Commerce Secretary – Enriquito implying that I was blackmailed into it which is a lot of hogwash as usual from Ninoy. But I can see that the Zobels do not like Maceda. Or more accurately, Ninoy Aquino is worried I am building up Maceda for President which is of course not true.<br>

I have the highest hopes for the Magalang Project to raise the standard of living of the peasants in Central Luzon. I will build infrastructures for them with the veterans of PHILCAG. I will protect them with the Home Defense Forces. This is the secret to peace and order in Central Luzon – the villagers defending their own homes. I understand from Liberal Congressman-elect Sanga of the 2nd district of Pampanga, 3/4 of the legal cadres in Pampanga have been driven away by the HDF units organizing alone. The villagers know who the communists are.<br>
I shall spread this idea all over the Philippines and into the cities by encouraging first the registration of guns then the training of the men who carry or possess them. Then defense for each block or building in a city can be built up by the Week-End Soldier concept.<br>
Tomorrow Imelda starts her Tulungan project in Tondo. It is principally jobs, housing, food and medicines. I have given the people the land titles. But we make them work for these and help themselves. This is also a pilot project for slums and depressed areas.<br>
Just a little hope for those in despair and we have the communists running.<br>
But yesterday I stood firm on the jeepney drivers’ strike and ordered the Metrocom to arrest any of the drivers violating the law and the strikers backed down. There was no violence and no disruption of transportation.<br>
Today I had lunch with Ka Erdie Manalo after I settled the SIS demonstrations. Received plenty of intelligence from the most unlikely sources.<br>

The Kabataang Makabayan has gone to the provinces to “learn from the people” actually teach-ins. In Arayat, the police (municipal) arrested the UP Collegian editor and others for showing a Red Chinese film without permit. This group issued a statement through the media that they were brought to Camp Olivas and beaten up. The truth is they were in the custody of the Arayat police all the time and were not touched at all.<br>
There should be immediate counter-action by the local leaders against these communist teach-ins.<br>
Let us locate some anti-communist films showing what the Huks have done and intend to do.<br>
Prepare propaganda leaflets for distribution. We can start with my letter to my children and the primer.<br>
The political leaders must now be taught how to conduct their own teach-ins.<br>
11:25 PM<br>
Suffered from too much durian which I ate when hungry. Relieved by three doses of gelusil and some food.<br>
After the confidential conferences in the morning, lunch with the Investors Association at Alta Vista which according to Ronnie Velasco has been condemned because of the earthquakes.<br>
2:30 – 3:00 PM – Met with Greg Licaros and Cesar Virata on the Monetary Board meeting which was supposed to pass as amendment to Circular 289 (80-20 retention scheme for the big four; copra, logs, sugar and copper) so that it becomes a ten percent across the board tax on all exports in excess of P5 million in 1968.<br>
But the senators who have been told of the holding back of exports because of the expectation momentarily of the passage of the lower export tax bill are standing pompously and pettily on their hurt pride. “If the monetary board can do it, why should we?” is Sen. Jose Diokno’s expression of senate feeling.<br>
So we have had to postpone action until next week.<br>
Tulungan was inaugurated by Imelda in Tondo this morning. Big success and turn out.<br>

Have just had dinner with the children while Imelda took dinner with Lindy and Cecile Locsin. A lot of ribbing and punning with the children. Imee reported that her mother “is the biggest cheater in the Jane Drew exercises.” In the sit-ups from lying on the back, she pushes up with her hands on the floor. On the bending to touch the toes<br>
opposite the touching hand, she spreads her legs so wide there is no effort to bend, etc. They were all good-naturedly reporting to me that after the ladies go through the exercises, they order all kind of food from the restaurants “so now mommy has gained one pound.” All of them have big hips “forty inches.” That is bigger than my chest at 37 inches I commented. Bongbong proudly claimed that he has only six inches to catch up with me – which claim the girls in a chorus questioned. A jolly good time – then my barber and dentist, the latter working on the teeth left by the Japanese Kempei Tai in Fort Santiago.<br>
Ordered the NBI, the CIS, PC and Metrocom to give support to the investigations of Rep. Pablo Ocampo on vices and corruption in the city which involves the mavor and his brothers, police officers and Chinese as well as an area commander of the Metrocom, Lt. Col.

Last night there was a story that Commander Dante was in the Far Eastern University Hospital for slipped disk – but negative results of a check.<br>
We must reactivate the assignment of highly trained squads to track down and get each Huk commander. The squad leader who is a highly trained officer should do nothing but think and act on his mission.<br>

Have just finished a conference with SND, J-2, 1st PC Zone Commander and his S-2 Col. Tomas Diaz, on an assessment.<br>
All the present books on counter-subversion and counter insurgency do not deal with our peculiar problem that is distinguished by a highly sophisticated use by the subversives of media, the schools, the church, labor, peasants and even industrialists in a massive scale. This is not just the 1950 struggle, it is more insidious and perhaps more pervasive. The same objective, the same motivation but more finesse, more articulate eloquence, more propaganda, more intellectuals, more open activism in front organizations – but less arms.<br>
This may be Maoist but it is not based on the Maoist doctrine of the rural areas being the base on the peasants and not the proletariat as the men of the revolution. So the counter-action must equally be more sophisticated<br>
Traditionally the peasants while shown the strength of the Armed Forces, must be given an alternative to communism. In 1950 this was the Eder and the resettlement projects and some government reforms. Today it is the Magalang Agricultural Community Development Project, Tulungan and the Integrated Social Welfare Program,<br>
economic development, CIR and CAR renovations, mobile courts and land reform.<br>
1:20 AM<br>
Just came from the dinner of Ronnie and Linda Velasco at their home in Dasmariñas. Sang the old songs, Red Sails in the Sunset, Balalanka, Goodnight, Sweetheart, etc.<br>
Alex Melchor and his parlour games. The rope trick and the blanket.<br>
I have ordered Makati as the pilot area for the registration of firearms and the organization of weekend warriors.<br>
De Leon, our asset on the Samar Training Camp who reported the death of three of his companions, two from Central Luzon, on the way to the training camp (drowned in the rapids) was subjected by Osmeña, Nic Tumulak and security group to questioning and lie detector test. Osmeña may have finally cleared but he is being sent to Sulu. He excused himself as still being too sick. I believe they intend to liquidate him. We should now submerge him.<br>
We must check the Iloilo situation. We will put up seven intelligence groups as permanent operating units with lateral and vertical channels of communication. Thus one unit would be covering the two islands of Negros and Panay. This is the possible hotbed of dissidence in the South.<br>

Imee won the topmost honors in school (1st year, Assumption Convent). In all her subjects. I wish she had been a boy. I went there at ten o’clock AM to pin the medal on her. She was quite nervous about it. And her teachers were proud of her. An Ilocana teacher commented “Ti paria hangan nga agbunga ti tarong.”<br>
Met with Hanz Menzi on his pulp project, his logging concession in Kalimantan pending with Pres. Suharto of Indonesia, his plantations in Talacag, Bukidnon, Mati, Davao Oriental and Basilan, as well as the publications (Bulletin where he holds 57% of the stock, Emilio Yap 30%, Enrique Zobel a small share and some Americans; Liwayway where he and Emilio Yap are split 50-50). I suggested he now appoint a managing company.<br>
Then Balao and Tante Rubio on their accounts on their enterprises. Balao has the Sierra Madre Logging in Cagayan – right now 20,000 hectares although he has a claim of 50,000 on the old area of Aguil and<br>
Then a conference at 3:00 PM.<br>

9:00 AM – Inaugurated the cold-cloud seeding rain production and typhoon moderation project. Philsugin donated three high-flying Cessnas (they can fly higher than 32,000 feet) for the project.<br>
11:00 AM – Com. Aquino on the Manila Bay Road with a causeway of about 500 meters wide. Also ordered the Manila North Diversion Road Extension and South Superhighway without cost to the government and cost to be recovered by tolls.<br>
l1:15 AM – Coordinated the BTTI and PTTA boards. Placed funds (P6.5 million) at the disposal of the BTTI only. Quarrels are stymying our tourist promotion plans.<br>
12:15 AM – Met the Mangyan delegation from Mindoro Oriental with Gov. Umali and Cong. Leido. They want reservation for their tribes which I ordered to be segregated by the Bureau of Forestry and the Bureau of Lands. They came in G-string and colorful tribal dress into the reception hall of the palace. Beneath the huge chandeliers they looked incongruous and unbelievable.<br>
Imelda is all pain from her exercising. Jazz from 4 to 5. Then exercise up to seven. Sauna bath of 15 minutes. Half an hour massage. All the blue ladies are worried about their figures. They are all putting on weight.<br>
The export tax bill is now in the period of amendments in the senate. But there are many provisions like total sterilization of the proceeds, applicability immediate on the four major exports and the rest only after thirty days.<br>
These must be removed in the conference committee.<br>
We have located the air strip of Arthur Beech who is actually the operations officer of the San Jose Timber Corp. of Louis Sheff and his wife at the source of the Catibog River Northern Samar. The training ground set up by Osmeña is close to there. And three men with de Leon, our asset perished in one of the falls of the river, so he is<br>
under suspicion. We will now look into the operations of Louis Sheff who has sold his house to Vic Fernandez the partner of Maceda in their reparations influence peddling, They made money on the items procured by PACD of which Maceda was the head. They have collected already $400,000.00.<br>
But Louis Sheff has plenty of money and no apparent source. He is probably engaged in smuggling.<br>

Gen. Lindbergh is here on the conservation of marine life. His son Jon Lindbergh is head of the U.S. Agency on Oceanography. With him is Theodore Pryor, head of the Foundation on Oceanography. Met them at 9:30 AM then attended the lunch for them where they tried durian and angolas which looked like worms but are eels.<br>
They have come from the Taboli and Obo areas in Cotabato where Lindbergh spent eight days. Pryor is going there too. Both under the guidance of Manda Elizalde.<br>
I am going to declare the Malampaya and Pangil bay estuaries as marine life sanctuaries if we can overcome the obstacles.<br>
Oceanography should be studied more by our people.<br>
And I have directed the Air and Water Pollution Commission to do something about the Pasig River which is now almost pure oil and waste.<br>
J.V. Cruz, the Manila Times columnist and one of my most ardent supporters has suddenly turned against me and suggests that “something has snapped somewhere” and I have become “hysterical” and “govern by intimidation.<br>
This is probably because I have not appointed him Ambassador to Bonn, Germany.<br>

I believe I should proclaim the entire Philippines as a land reform area provided that the farmers will agree not to seek or demand loans from the government for their inputs as we do not have the funds. But I still think that we must organize cooperatives And the Magalang project will be the pilot project for this kind of cooperative.<br>
We have been able to get the senators to agree to a caucus to have me convince them that we must allow the collections from the export tax for our foreign and domestic indebtedness. We meet for breakfast at 8:30 AM Monday, April 27th.<br>
I have appointed Francisco Rabat as chairman of PHILCOA and hope that he will have the drive to organize cooperatives for coconut producers.<br>
Had Leo Virata and Tony Ayala for lunch. Asked them to approve the Menzi application for a pulp and paper plant as there was a letter guaranty of the produce to be bought by them.<br>
Met with J.V. Cruz for lunch and he claims he is worried about the control of the military over government. So I explained to him that we must keep a dialogue with the military as they could be a threat if I did not dominate them morally.<br>
I am appointing him Ambassador to Bonn, Germany as this seems to be his wish and I promised this to him during the campaign of 1969.<br>

AID is pulling out at least twenty percent of its personnel as the U.S. decides to withdraw aid all over the world. This has been in the offing for several years. But perhaps it is about time we cut off all aid to us and really be self-reliant.<br>
We are losing $7 million daily in dollar earnings because of the refusal of the senators to pass an acceptable export tax bill. They want to sterilize the entire proceeds in the Central Bank. But our debts are coming up. At the same time the senate version prohibits further borrowing. It amends the Charter of the Central Bank and stops all open-market operations of the bank.<br>
So I have called a caucus of the congressional leaders tomorrow morning at 8:30 AM to work out a compromise.<br>
Boni Ysip reports that another military group headed by Ex-Gen. Tiro Fajardo has organized and is in touch with the original group of Terry Adevoso.<br>
Ex-Pres. Macapagal and family has left for Dacca, Pakistan. Adevoso and some other cabinet members of his including Mayor Asistio saw him off.<br>
Ex-Sen. Domocao Alonto has arrived from abroad and wishes to see me. His Ansarul Islam is still being talked about as supporting secession from the Philippines of the Moslem areas. But we are organizing the loyal moslems to fight back if they start anything.<br>

In the breakfast this morning I convinced the senators and congress leaders to agree to:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2004" data-line-end="2005">A flat rate of 10% for all exports more than $5 million provided that the export incentives bill will be approved.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2005" data-line-end="2009">The proceeds will be spent as follows:<br>
50% for the payment of foreign and domestic obligations;<br>
25% for the counterpart fund for loans from the ADB, IBRD and other foreign sources;<br>
25% for expenses for unfinished productive enterprises.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2009" data-line-end="2012">Only Sen. Jose Diokno is presently opposing the removal of Sec. 5 of the Senate Bill which amends the Charter of the Central Bank, removes the open-market operations of the Central Bank, and stops further loans in excess of the present level of our indebtedness. But this will mean that we will not be able to pay our debts.<br>
We offered a compromise that additional indebtedness will not exceed 15% of the last three years of income.<br>
Opened the convention of the governors and city mayors. I appealed to them:</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2012" data-line-end="2013">To be in the forefront of change so that we will not allow the radicals to preempt our right as leaders chosen by our people.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2013" data-line-end="2014">That our times are crucial and each and everyone of us will determine the future of our country in the next century.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2014" data-line-end="2016">That we must now establish centers of activity other than Metropolitan Manila. That the reason Manila is the center of authority is because the President holds office in Manila, so I will now hold office in regional office.<br>
4 That local development is dependent more upon the initiatives of the local leaders than on the experts of the national government. Cigar rolling factories in Cagayan was my example.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2016" data-line-end="2017">That they must now help develop cooperatives of agricultural producers to tie up with consumer cooperatives so that there will be local markets in the provinces. Right now the only market is in Manila.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2017" data-line-end="2018">That island provinces should look into the development of refrigerated warehouses. That this could be utilized also by other and inland provinces. Gov. San Luis of Laguna immediately asked that I reverse the decision of GAO that the savings of the provinces cannot be used for cooperatives.</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2018" data-line-end="2024">That I will proclaim land reform for the entire Philippines before the end of my term but that we have no funds for credit to the tenants and the small land owners should be banded into farm cooperatives, as it is true that larger farms are more efficient.<br>
Electrification.<br>
Vocational and agricultural schools.<br>
Take issue openly with the enemies of liberal democracy – those specially who would use violence.<br>
We will tolerate debate. But we should not forfeit our right of reply. For we have more valid arguments. History is on our side.<br>

Am still awaiting word from the conference committee on the stabilization tax on whether they have agreed on the version that we worked out. Substantially as we agreed in the caucus but 25% of proceeds to be sterilized in a special fund in the Central to be spent only by Congressional authorization; the prohibition of additional indebtedness when there is inflationary dangers and the categorization which is the subject of contention in the Savoy Hotel conference committee meeting.<br>
My feeling is that Sen. Pres. Puyat, Majority Floor Leader Tolentino and Chairman on Ways &amp; Means Lagumbay are protecting their private interests – setting 10% for the big exports (logs, copra, sugar and copper concentrate) and 8% for the rest including dessicated coconut and plywood of Puyat, Lagumbays and Tolentinos retainers.<br>
If this is the only way to pass the bill we will have to accept the categorization although Lening Veloso who feels that the congressmen have been kept out of the deals with the exporters says the House wants only one category and a flat rate of 10%. The Secretary of Finance is there with them.<br>
Greg Licaros called me up to say that we may get the $50 million loan by Thursday.<br>
My stamina is increasing. A daily heavy exercise routine morning and afternoon and I do not feel tired.<br>

The conference committee on the stabilization tax bill approved the conference report with the amendment that instead of sterilization of the last 25% of the proceeds it goes to the DBP for the payment of its obligations. I sent Leo Virata to the Senate to explain to the Nacionalista senators’ caucus that he has obligations that are urgent – $67 million by the end of the month and $289 million by the end of June.<br>
The House has approved the conference report but the Senate is still debating it although Senate President Gil Puyat promised they would hold on and keep the session going until it is approved.<br>
The Labor groups have allegedly withdrawn their invitation for me to address them on Labor Day, May 1st. Before that Sec. Ople on his own announced that for security reasons I am not attending the Labor Day celebration. Labor is supposed to demonstrate against Congress and me because I certified the bill on minimum wage for P8 for industrial and P5 for non-industrial workers.<br>
Ople recommends that I meet with the labor leaders and I have agreed to do so tomorrow noon at 1:00 PM. But I do not wish to compromise as the labor leaders are getting too arrogant and are trying to intimidate the Congress and me.<br>
Actually the minimum wage should be P7 and P4.50.<br>

San Isidro, Magalang for an inspection of the Home Defense Forces or the self-defense forces. It is a model. They have a good 93 men. But their trenches need overhead cover as the Huks have M-79’s.<br>
10:30 – Fort Magsaysay, 30 minutes by helicopter.

We must improve our artillery and use the helicopters for fire support. Communications good – all messages in Tagalog. The “over” sounded strange when translated into “Tapos.” Air drop of the pathfinders off the drop zone. Vice Chief of Staff Romeo Espino dropped with them from 6,000 feet. In actual combat they drop from 12,000 three days before combat to mark out the drop zone. Two of them were carried by an updraft two miles beyond the camp.<br>

This is my 16th Wedding Anniversary. Mass at 7:00 AM.<br>
But the children had a surprise for us. They barged into our room shouting like demonstrators dressed up like radicals with head bands and molotov cocktails (actually dry ice in water in 7-Up bottles, smoking like activated bomb). They carried placards like “Demonstration by the atrocious products of this happy union.”<br>
At the side door they had all their pets, the dogs including old Blacky my old pet German shepherd in San Juan and young Urduja – Button the small Shetland pony, Snow White and the Ilocano sheep.<br>
Breakfast – then met with Mr. Aquino, the head of UN FAO with Mr. Joseph to whom I have given a plaque as he is leaving for Rome, and Dr. Faronki. They are giving us millions of dollars worth of food for our big impact projects, Nutritional program in Medicare, the Pantabangan as well as others like Candaba fishponds and reclamation.<br>
Signed the Stabilization tax bill at 12:00 AM. Then met the labor leaders. Delivered my labor day speech over television and radio on the State Dining Room.<br>
Napped up to 5:00 PM from 4:00 PM. Then exercised with Imelda who later walked with me, Greg Licaros and Bobby Benedicto who both arrived later, in the golf course.<br>
We have also been granted the $50 million stand-by loan from Japan. Next the restructuring of our foreign loans.<br>

I write this on the 3rd as we were busy up to 1:30 AM last night with Meldy and after that I fell asleep. Woke up at 5:30 but went back to bed till 8:00 when Imelda and I talked in bed about all the things she and I had been through together since we were married in 1954 when I was but a congressman. We agreed we had been well blessed by God. She was concerned about Bongbong going to England and how we would miss him. When I laughingly asked her what she would do if he brought home a child with an English mother, she said seriously and intensely – “keep the child but not the mother.” She thought that we would then have a child to play with. I jokingly asked why she felt that way about her son but not about her husband, she said, I love you so much I would be willing to allow you to have a child by another woman if you wanted it (another child) so much, but I have to be there and you must do so not because of love for the woman. Of course we both laughed the thought off with unanimous assurances of love.<br>
PAF day at 9:00 AM May 2nd. Was late 20 minutes, got out as the Blue Diamonds demonstrated their precision playing at 11:00 AM. Went to say goodbye to those leaving for abroad. Had a light lunch, assurances of mutual trust and then arrived at Pier 15 at 2:05 PM but had to wait for the jewelry of Meldy left behind at the palace by Lucy. Finally cast off the pier at 2:30 PM. Slept at 3:00-5:00 PM, practiced golf at 6:00-7:00, exercised up to 7:30, massage from 8:00-9:30 (actually Bongbong and I were talking about the guns he brought along and the hunting in Sibito). Dinner at 10:45 PM.<br>

Have just issued the statement in Puerto Princesa that the operations of the South Vietnamese and American troops against the Vietcong and Vietminh in Cambodia is not an invasion but a measure of self-protection which any commander in the field would take given the situation of the privileged sanctuary of supply depots, arms and ammo factories, communications and headquarters from which the Vietcong and Vietminh continuously stage repeated attacks. I suppose it will make the headlines tomorrow.<br>
Ambassador Byroade says tonight that the American bombers (100 of them) have bombed North Vietnam missile and anti-aircraft sites. They should have done this a long time ago.<br>
The damage in Cambodia must have been terrific because the enemy did not expect it and their installations are all on surface. I presume their anti-aircraft is not as sophisticated as in North Vietnam.<br>
If the supplies from Cambodia are cut, the Vietcong and Vietminh fighting in South Vietnam will be greatly weakened.<br>
Nixon is under attack from some of the U.S. congressional leaders but he did the right thing and if he pushes it through, he may become a great President because it is just possible that if Red China reacts violently and starts war, that may be the end of Red China. I believe Russia will keep quiet about it and let Red China stew in her own sauce.<br>
The decision of Nixon will strengthen the free nations of Asia and weaken the home-grown communists who have been encouraged by the wishy-washy American policy.<br>
The countries in the Chinese mainland are the ones who must be cheering the most specially Laos, Burma, Thailand, Malaysia and Korea (of course Cambodia).<br>
We reached Puerto Princesa at 3:00 PM sharp. We had left off Ambassador Byroade in the lifeboat and guarded by the destroyer escort at the entrance to the bay at 2:00 PM. He came back at 5:30. He or rather Mrs. Cecille Locsin caught a spanish mackerel which was cooked as kilawin for dinner.<br>
Cast off at 7:00 PM for Ursula. I have asked everybody to go to bed at 10:00 PM so we can wake them up at 4:00 AM, give them 30 minutes to dress up, start ship to shore movement at 4:30 and be on the beach for the 5:20 sunrise and the waking up and departure of the birds.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2110" data-line-end="2116">Ursula Island was a disappointment. There was rain at about 5:30 AM and there were no birds. We were all wet so we went swimming after which I went into the forest. Felt a mosquito bite so I have insisted everybody take comaquin as a phrophylaxis against malaria although we had taken atabrine or quinine yesterday. But it is a beautiful island. And the birds were in the forest which had no thick underbrush. I am told there were some hunters there a week ago. We should shoot the hunters instead as I had proclaimed Ursula island as a bird sanctuary in 1968. We must place notices in the island about this – the proclamation I mean.<br>
I had been awakened at 4:15 AM by Imelda. We were back at the 777 by 7:30 AM and I was asleep at 8:30 AM. Woke up at 11:00 AM.<br>
Arrived at Taganak at S:15 PM. The mayor led us to eight young turtles and two nests. We hunted around for the eggs with the aid of an iron prod with which you can feel the eggs like rubbery obstacles. Then we saw a giant mother turtle.<br>
We have just had a discotheque with everybody in the weirdest clothing. This was organized by the children. The last piece was 17 minutes long and anybody who sat down before the end was considered ancient, the children proclaimed. The “olds” also had to keep on at it till the fatiguing end.<br>
The sea is a little rough. The ship is pitching and yawing as we are in the Sulu Sea on the way to Sibuto where we hope to hunt boar before we go to General Santos and the Dole Pineapple plantation.<br>

I write this on the th as we went to bed at 2:00 PM last night after a futile hunt for wild boar until 11:30 PM. We had decided to postpone our trip by twelve hours as we could hunt only in the evening.<br>
Father , (Sibutu Notre Dame School) has done a fine job. When I landed on the airstrip there in 1965 I landed in the Aero-Commander the Irene on 450 meters of rough corral. Now it is 840 meters planted to Bermuda grass which was brought by Father Chalkey from Jolo in 196&amp;. A Queenaire could land there easily. The campus is all lovely Bermuda grass.<br>
There was a program given by the people of the island led by Deputy Gov. Bandon and Acting Mayor Inna Carlos formerly 1st Councilor as Mayor Mansur was suspended Judge Bidui (from Sibutu) of the Jolo CFI for anti-graft charges. congratulated the people for their helping themselves. There is no doctor or nurse, only a midwife so I have directed Sec. Cruz to appoint a rural health doctor for the municipality of Sitangkai of which Sibutu is a part.<br>
We were to leave at 12:00 noon to give Ambassador Byroade some time to fish but as he had not been able to get any and we wanted to hunt so I could get Bongbong to kill his first boar with me, we decided to leave at night after the hunt.<br>
We were prepared to be in place at 5:00 PM but we were at the father’s place at 4:00 PM. He brought us to the Pool of the Eleven Thousand Virgins which was a deep dark pool under a balete tree and in a deep cavern with an overhanging limestone ledge over it. Small (probably ten meters by ten) but cool and lovely. By the time we returned to the Notre Dame school, it was 5:30 PM (4 kilometers) and Imelda and Ambassador Byroade (who had gone fishing in the afternoon) were waiting for the only jeep in the island then at our disposal, so that it was six o’clock when we went to the hunting place which was to the eastern side of the island by a narrow path which the jeep could hardly negotiate (about five kilometers) and another two or three kilometers in the dark to the perches for us. These are rickety platforms ten meters up a coconut tree where we were to wait for the boar.<br>
I was with Bongbong and Aquil our guide. We had gone out the farthest from the road, passing through the seashore which was white sand typical of the islands in these seas. Bongbong was armed with the Steyr-Marlicher .223, I had a Remington 12 gauge shotgun which scope I took off and for which I had to borrow three shotgun shells (buckshot double 0) because the men had brought number 4 shots for the magnum 3 inch and no. 8 trap loads for the regular 12 gauge 2 3/4 inch shotgun; Aquil was holding the .22 Martin magnum.<br>
We waited for four hours. We could hear the soughing of the surf and fish falling back on the water like a rifle shot. I could smell the jungle again. And even if we had used OFF repelant, I still got beaten by some insects.<br>
Bongbong was excited when we climbed up those wobbly steps nailed uncertainly to the coconut trunk and he whispered to me “We are really here, Daddy.”<br>
In a way I am glad we got nothing as it will teach the boy patience. He was quite self-restrained for his age.<br>
My feet hurt from the long hike as my shoes were too thin-soled for it. And it reminded me of the many marches in the jungles long, long ago as I smelled the jungle again.<br>
But I must bring him to Cagayan to shoot his first boar and duck.<br>
We did hear one of the boars rooting around in the bushes and crack a coconut or two but he did not come out in the open as Aquil did not turn on the flashlight he was holding for the occassion.<br>

And the resolution filed by Cong. A. Diaz of Zambales to request me to declare Admiral Lambert and other base officials as persona non grata I have asked to be stopped. Cong. Diaz has become a pompous impertinent tyrant according to Mayor Gordon of Olongapo.<br>

Romulo at 4:30 PM. Arrived at 2:35, showered and slept for 30 minutes. Then conferred with my Executive Secretary, Sec. Ponce Enrile, Com. Edmundo Reyes on the Yuyitong case. They explained that these two brothers were both planning a sudden disappearance and were also in danger of liquidation by rightist elements.<br>
Registration of guns liberalized – Sec. Ponce Enrile ordered.<br>

I write this only tonight as the trip by boat last night was rough and I went to sleep at 11:00 PM. We started from Pier 15 at 8:15 and arrived at the San Fernando pier at 9:45 AM today. Outside the breakwater we were on a SE course with the wind from the North so we were rolling a little. This stopped when we rounded Cochines point at the south of the Bataan Peninsula. But the swells in the China Sea made Bongbong sick, he had to be given half a bonamine. Stevie Cu Unjieng vomited twice and Tessie Yulo once. But the rest were all good sailors.<br>
In the morning I left at 7:30 AM to Lipa City – Fernando Air Base to speak at the graduation of the Flying Cadets (19) and student officers (12 and PMA’ers). Had to travel by car and it took us one hour and a half because of the fact that the airplane crashes have made Meldy nervous everytime I fly. (We just received from PAL the picture of the AVRO plane that crashed at Pantabangan with its tail section blown off apparently by explosives, then the right wing disintegrating then turning upside down just before impact on the ground). The PAC plane of Boy Tuason, Andy Roxas and Peggy Lim had an engine burn on take-off, the pilot feathered it but banked steeply on the dead engine instead of the functioning one, so stalled and crashed on its nose. The PAL Fokker plane that crashed in Iligan took off below minimal requirements as it was raining heavily and visibility was 100 yards, hit a mound of dirt on the side, twisted around and burned after all the passengers had escaped the plane. The stewardess who was about to put on her belt was thrown off the door that flew open and died of a cracked skull (the only casualty).<br>
Returned to Manila at 10:30 AM to arrive at the Escolta PNB building at 12:00 to address the Rice and Corn Federation convention.<br>
Then went to Malacañang at 1:00 PM to meet Gen. Menzi on his Pulp and Paper project and the PHILCOX man, Tony Tiotko on the navigational aids valued at $12.5 million they are installing.<br>
At 3:00 PM after some conferences and a 15 minute nap, I was at Del Monte to inaugurate the new 15,000 cavan a day rice polishing and processing plant of the Mindanao Progress Corporation of Roberto Tulio. Conference at Bonifacio 4:30 PM to 7:00. Malacañan to pick up some books, papers and clothes and was at the boat at 7:30 PM where I met Henry Martel on the Navotas reclamation project of Ramon Clinamco and Monching Cojuangco on the PLDT franchise which Maj. Fl. Leader Veloso badly mishandled. I had warned him that his asking ₱200,000 only for Montano the minority floor leader was going to lead to a scandal. Monching Cojuangco also went ahead and paid the grease money although I do not believe Lening when he says that he did not keep any part of it. The House on the motion of Maning Zosa and the promptings of Danding Cojuangco voted to recall of the franchise and now there is a serious move to change Veloso as majority floor leader.<br>
I scolded Monching a little for the bungling.<br>
Imelda is smarting from Nini Quezon Avanceña’s remarks to Fanny Aldaba Lim that we may be hardworking, intelligent and sincere but we are making too much money. She mentioned Al Yuchengco. We are also supposed to own Atlas, Dole, AG&amp;P and other big corporations. If they only knew!!!<br>

Imelda is depressed that we have had no children after Irene. She was overdue since the 13th but on the 25th had it. Since then she has been feeling frustrated. But everything depends on God. If He wills it we will have more children. And we will take all the necessary medical measures to have some more. I would like to have another son.<br>
And I am at my healthiest. I am healthier now than I was at forty years.<br>
There is a slump in the stock market in the U.S. affecting all the other countries and including the Philippines. This is the time to buy. Even Benguet Consolidated has gone down to Five Dollars but today went up to Six Dollars. So when I was asked for advise, I said that now is the time to buy.<br>
We must develop our mining industry. And everybody is looking for mines. Chino Roces and Max Soliven have written the Human Rights Commission that we violated the Declaration of Human Rights in deporting the Yuyitongs. So the Sec. of Foreign Affairs must answer this communication.<br>
Max Soliven is a frustrated politician who would like to go back to the district of his father and follow on his footsteps but cannot. He is taking it out on me. Chino Roces is a naive and weak little tyrant who wants to control presidents and be kowtowed to.<br>

The children left Hongkong by Jumbo jet as Pan-Am has a Jumbo flight everyday that leaves at 9:00 AM Hongkong Time which is one hour ahead of Manila. They arrived at 12:45 PM but landed at 1:15 PM. They stay at the new Imperial Hotel. They had a rough trip. Up to now it is still raining in Manila as it did yesterday even in the making of the pledge at Rizal Park. And the children say that the landing was like a house coming down in an earthquake.<br>
Had nine holes in the USAFIP-Maharlika tournament at Fort Bonifacio. Then had a conference. Met the Capitan del Barrio and the people of 8 provinces and about 600 doctors of PGH led by Director Pascual recommending my brother Dr. Pacifico Marcos for the position of Chairman of the Medical Care Commission.<br>
Then met with the Meralco group to look into the Chronicle and ABS-CBN malicious distortions of news and mischievous commentaries.<br>

<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2210" data-line-end="2219">We have just said goodbye to Father James Donalan who went to England to look into all the schools that Bongbong could go to. He recommended Worth Abbey School.<br>
He recommended it because of its spartan system that develops individual initiative, the youth and progressiveness of the rector (Benedictine), the tutorship (there are thirty members of the faculty and only 300 boys. The Soriano and Delgado boys are there). Father Donalan says that when a boy has finished the 4th, 5th and 6th Forms one is a junior in an American college.<br>
So I have prepared a letter and cable to be sent to Father Dominic, Worth father rector, to enroll Bongbong for the next term.<br>
There are some criticisms (specially Max Soliven) of the decision to send Bongbong to England but it offers the best education for a boy. In the Philippines, he is either spoiled or hated because he is the President’s son. And he has to learn to stand on his own. But he has to learn Ilocano before he goes. So I may send him to the north first.<br>
I am now working on the monetary policies – and the reforms in the government financing institution.<br>

Held a caucus luncheon with about 20 of the Senate and House leaders. They suggested we do not talk of another special session yet so that we can push all the bills in this special session. We agreed to take up in the order of precedence:</p>
<ol>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2226" data-line-end="2227">Peace and Order Fund</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2227" data-line-end="2228">Amendment of Borrowing Authority</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2228" data-line-end="2229">Tariff Code Amendment</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2229" data-line-end="2230">Sale of Military Camps</li>
<li class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2230" data-line-end="2241">Amnesty for Taxes.<br>
But if they do not finish their work, I will call another special session.<br>
Tried to settle the quarrel between Gen, Garcia, Chief of PC, and Rep. Antonio Diaz, but Gen. Garcia has gone on TV and declared he will not receive orders from Rep. Diaz on PC matters which is correct but impolite. I have called a conference on smuggling and army problems tomorrow afternoon at 4:30 PM then dinner.<br>
Bongbong has started his Latin and French lessons under Mr. Sung as he has never taken these in school. I have also gotten him to work on his British history. He has only taken Pre-Roman and a part of the Roman period.<br>
Bongbong has started to call me ERPI – a contraction of ERPAT, the inverse of PATER. He is beginning to use his latin.<br>
Hikky – We just got instructed on French kissing by our children. The black mark on Imelda’s neck which I put on her the other day was immediately called a Hiki by our two eldest – the result of a sucking kiss.<br>
We are all sleeping in our bedroom tonight. The children were all kidding us that if there should be another child, they would all be “DJALOUZ.” I suggested in jest that their mother was willing for me to have children by other women and they said “Unthinkable.” Although they were laughing, I knew they were serious.<br>
I told them, too, that if Mommy should ever leave us, I would never marry again.<br>
Bongbong said in bravado, “Why do you want any other sons when I am worth a thousand sons.” And I hope he will be.<br>
I told him I want him to be challenged. He retorted he needed no challenge to be good.<br>

Imelda visited Nini this afternoon with Dr. Estefania Aldaba Lim to make amends for the hurt that Hartzel Spence’ book on me. And she brought my letter of regrets. For the book had made it appear as if Pres. Quezon had persecuted me when the truth was that the subalterns, Maj. Guado of the NBI, then Fiscal Macadaeg, the Valle brothers of Tarlac, had done the falsification of the evidence specially the testimony of Calixto Aguinaldo from sheer bureaucratic overzealousness. Pres. Quezon had merely ordered justice to be meted out to the guilty party as I do now as President.<br>
I believe I have prevented a PAL strike after I got CAB to increase the domestic rates and PAL increase the wages although this is not apparently acceptable to the unions.<br>
Am working on the inclusion of administration press stories in the news throw-in sheet of the magazines specially the Liwayway Publications.<br>

Speculations will continue snowballing about her running for President after me.<br>
Assured the German financiers and suppliers of Abaca Pulp and Paper Industry that the government is interested in the project and will push it through. This was necessary as the funds have lain idle for some time.<br>
Scolded Gen. Garcia for announcing that he had ordered 3,000 armalites for the PC. In the first place this is not true as only two thousand five hundred have been bought and it was not his idea. It violates our security measures.<br>
Am pushing the setting up of occupancy installations in Flat Island and Naushan Island because Freedom Island or Itu Ato has been occupied by the Nationalist government. I ordered the Air Force to air-photo the islands and they have submitted their report. The occupancy of Flat Island and Naushan Island will protect our shores – Palawan and our present grant of oil drilling rights in the Palawan shelf to the Seafront.<br>

Have just arrived from the wedding of Kits Tatad at Greenhills Church and reception at Intercontinental. Well attended by newspaper people including those who do not wish us well.<br>
Received the letter of Nonong signed Manuel L. Quezon Jr., expressing happiness over “my gentlemanly letter” that “vindicated the honor of father and sister by rejecting the unjust imputations and insinuations levelled at them.” Formal and a little cold, I thought.<br>
Vice Pres. Lopez wrote me insisting upon his power to control and supervise the Bureau of Forestry including the issuance of licenses. But I am certain this is done by his men who wish to continue collecting from the licenses.<br>
I worked on the oil concession applications. And asked Ting Paterno and Cesar Virata to finish the letter to the Jacintos on the IISMI converting government preferred shares to common voting shares and putting IISMI under a new management, foreign if necessary.<br>

The Daily Mirror (most of the wise coffee-shop habitues call it the Daily Error) headlines that Sen. Lagumbay is being punished by me for refusing to sponsor tax measures – which is completely false as the truth is this is a Senate matter triggered by the newspapers and taken over by the Perez committee. I could not in conscience do anything but authorize the BIR to reveal his name.<br>
Now Aytona is caught in a bind for conflict of interest.<br>
The PNB Union and PAGE (Phil. Association of Government Employees) are also threatening a strike or demonstration.<br>
They could not come at 6:30 PM and so I meet them at 12:00 noon tomorrow.<br>
Played golf early in the tournament at Bonifacio to raise funds for the watering system.<br>
Came back to the Palace in a hurry to catch the Ilocos Norte mayors and delegation being briefed by Imelda on their program for me on Monday, the eve of my birthday celebration. Retreated when Imelda shooed me away.<br>
Inaugurated at 5:00 PM the CAA-PAF management operation and information center. Gave a plaque of appreciation to Gen. McNickle of the 13th Air Force USAF for the help like the radar we are using at MIA now, electric generators after the earthquake, etc.<br>
1:10 AM<br>
Have just arrived from Sec. Romulo’s house at Forbes Park where the cabinet tendered me a dinner for my birthday celebration on the 1st of September.<br>
He had been able to collect an impressive collection of cablegrams from heads of state and heads of government. Although this message-sending is a yearly occurrence.<br>
Dinner was up to 10:00 PM – then a reception and dance up to 12:15 AM.<br>
This is a tradition I hope will be followed throughout the years as a President must depend for success upon his cabinet.<br>
We also had the first picture taken of the cabinet with me (only the Vice-President was absent).<br>
I am getting all the cabinet men to work. As I said in my response to Sec. Romulo, there is one basic difference between the cabinet of Pres. Quezon and my cabinet and that is that Quezon’s cabinet was composed mostly of political kingpins while my cabinet is composed of technocrats mostly without political backing.<br>
I also announced the policy of more autonomy for bureau directors and department heads as well as the objective of establishing a civil service that can operate efficiently without the intervention except on basic policy of an elective legislature or even the President or department head.<br>

The talk of the town is still the capture of Commander Sumulong. The Liberals are sour graping as usual, Roxas and Aquino insinuating that it was a rigged-up surrender and not a capture. They just want their names in the front pages.<br>
It turns out that he was turned in by a certain Ato, a former close-in security man whom he trusted but whom he had scolded about money.<br>
One of the first men he wanted to talk to was Cong. Cojuangco whom he wanted to secure a lawyer for him.<br>
Talked to Imelda at Lisbon (a 7-hour time difference) for more than an hour (1:10 PM to 2:15 PM.) She was given tea by the President and the Sec. of Foreign Affairs was giving her a reception in the afternoon.<br>
She talked of what Bongbong had told her when she called him last from London. The pictures in his album had one of the family against the giant chandeliers of the palace and some of his classmates wanted to know if his father was a minister since we seemed to be in a cathedral. And he has already cured the sniffles of a roommate with Decolgen. Breakfast is not so bad as he gets a one-inch thick ham. For lunch and dinner the food seems substantial. But he has to clean the bathroom and classroom. And he is acquiring the technique so he can finish this in five minutes. He has avoided rugby until he learns the game but he has sported around his judo green belt. He feels some of his classmates are “stupes” and he is “doing well indeed” in his classes. So much so he is in the senior class in mathematics. But his uniform is three sizes too large and his mother left him no English currency and the school store would not accept his dollars. A second year boy sneered “These Asians” when he was with a Middle East boy in the first day and he cursed him back in Tagalog. But since then he has not consorted with the Middle East boy as the hijacking Arabs are not exactly popular. Otherwise he has made friends with all the 200 classmates.<br>
Apparently he likes it out there although he says he will take the first plane home next December.<br>
I am glad the school disciplines the students and makes them work cleaning bathrooms and classrooms as well as helping the monks in cleaning up the walls. Bongbong says that the teachers do not press you to study but if you do not you just flunk and have to take the subject all over again. This will instill not only self-discipline but also develop initiative.<br>
He is turning out to be a businessman. He has sold chocolates and balisong. He will probably earn more than his two pounds allowance per month.<br>
But he wants to travel to Scotland and Ireland. And I believe we should encourage him in this.<br>
One of the biggest surprises of our lives is the report that the locker of Bongbong is so neatly arranged that the housemaster has referred to it as a model for the other boys. Three cheers for him!<br>
Met some of the oil concessioners. I may have to order a rebidding of the concessions in the Sulu-Palawan area.<br>
Asked the Jacintos and Sen. Aytona in the dinner I invited them to, to go to Washington and find out if the report is true that the Export Import Bank will not restructure the IISMI loan if they do not improve management and equity.<br>
The Japanese suppliers are ready to help restructure their raw material loans of $72.5 million as Nanding Jacinto claims the Japanese cannot cut their credit because we are the biggest buyer of iron raw materials.<br>
We will have to wait for the return of the Jacintos.<br>

And we are impotent to do anything as this woman wants publicity. If we file a libel or blackmail case, she will just thrive in it. And it will blow up the whole thing into an international affair and fair game for everyone.<br>

I write this as I stay by Imelda who is in bed in our bedroom as she is feeling sick.<br>
We are trying to call up Col. Los Baños, the military attaché in London, so we can tell him to allow Bongbong to come home by plane alone but to inform the embassies on the way to watch for him. He may be coming from London on the 10th with the Zobel boys by Quantas which has a direct flight to the Philippines and Australia.<br>
And I am trying to call Bobby Benedicto. I have talked to him to rib him about his cable. He informs me that the interrogation of Mendoza was shown over TV in New York which is incidentally very cold. Mendoza said it was President Marcos who parried his thrusts with his kris-dagger and who prevented him from killing the Pope.<br>
Met Mr. D.G.H. Rowlands of Thompson Foundation of England. He is the editorial studies director.<br>
Signed the pardons for prisoners as I promised the Pope. And I have ordered that the prisoners penalized with imprisonment of not more than 5 years be kept in the provinces with expenses to be divided between the national and the provincial governments.<br>

Imelda and I are going to sleep at Suite I which is actually the guest room for heads of state. Our big bed which was blessed by the Holy Father is there. Imelda and I had sentimental reminiscences of Paris and New York in November on our honeymoon in 1954 bacause of the chestnut glace.<br>
Talked to Bongbong and Father Bernard. Bongbong says the attempted assassination of the Pope was prominent front page in the London newspapers and while they explained that there had been doubt as to who had saved the Pope’s life, Mendoza, the would be assassin had been asked and he had pointed to me as the man who had parried the knife thrusts. And Bongbong is quite proud of his father. “Runs in the family,” he bragged. Father Bernard says in the last fortnight Bongbong has been lazy but well adjusted. He makes believe he knows but he does not. In history he has been observed to be “flippant” and his ideas not well thought out.<br>
Bongbong leaves Worth on the 10th, leaves London for Rome by Alitalia at about 10:00 AM on the 11th, takes PAL from Rome to Manila and arrives at Manila at about 2:00 PM on the 12th (Sunday).<br>
Am working on cooperatives, free schooling, electrification, land reform, manpower training and the other projects.<br>
Mons. Gavin of Malaysia has issued the statement that he did not see me parry the<br>
knife thrust of Mendoza. This appeared in The Evening News.<br>
The Daily Mirror, however, carried the statement of the Archbishop of Indonesia to the effect that he did see me do so.<br>
As usual in the occurrence of a sudden and fast event, there are several versions. Doroy Valencia, the columnist, says, who should know best but the would be assassin, Mendoza.<br>

Bongbong has just arrived. His plane a KLM-PAL DC-8 on direct flight from Amsterdam touched down at about 3:00 PM. A sizeable crowd with the usual palace friends and their children were there to greet him. The people up in the visitors terrace shouted “Bongbong” and waved to him happily. You could see they were as glad as we were to see him home for the holidays.<br>
And we have been excitedly preparing for his arrival. His room has been refurnished and redone by Pandot Ocampo. We have put in our share.<br>
The girls fixed up his and their rooms to look lived in and cozy. I put in there the stamps we struck for the Pope on his visit and the knives given me by Mayor Hernando of San Nicolas.<br>
And we had the horses waiting for him at the aviary. His horse Argentina was there and at first he shied away from him. Button and Kitten were also there. The dogs were inside because it was showering as it has been the whole day. His favorite, Sandy, of course was there. And so was Achilles the Dalmatian and the two chows, Butterball and Alaska.<br>
After the hurry and scurry to look into his room and the peremptory demands for <em>kuwento</em>, we heard mass then merienda when he told us a lot of stories.<br>
He had come to the landing ramp when we were out of the VIP reception room and he apparently had cut his hair short but it still looked long and was way down to his collar.<br>
But the first impact was a pleasant shock. He had lost his darkness and he looked unbelievably handsome. I could see and hear that this was also the effect on his mother and the Ilocano mayors who were there.<br>
He had acquired some kind of an English accent and the peculiary English terms like “frightful,” “dreadful,” “chap.”<br>
But he was changed much deeper than mere accent or adeptness in the English language.<br>
He now placed greater importance on his academics than on sports. He casually announced that he would have to give up his judo as it cuts into his study and work on physics. And he bragged of his being told by his master that they would recommend his elevation or acceleration in physics. He also bragged that he was third in mathematics in a class of 120. Although we did hear of rugby or “rugger.”<br>
Imelda and I are agreed that we made the right decision in sending him to England. And we remembered our fears of friends as well as enemies spoiling him, of drug-addiction, of leftists, threats of kidnapping and the fate of Presidents’ sons in the Philippine society that gave them no incentive for excellence.<br>
Imelda and I were both in tears (of happiness of course) when we met him and talked to him. I noticed that Imelda hugged him longer than usual as I did. And she whispered to me, “You were right, we have lost a child. He is now turning into a man. We can no longer baby him.” I answered. “We will just have to have another child to baby!”<br>
This has been a happy day!<br>

Monday<br>
Our first day with Bongbong. Woke up late believing he would not be able to awake early but he had breakfast with the two girls before seven o’clock.<br>
He looked bored the whole morning as I attended to my visitors — Ambassador Urabe, Mrs. Adelina Rodriguez, the Cavite officials on Sangley Pt. (we decided to inform the American Ambassador we would like to see the turn-over take place finally after one year; we are going to set aside an area for a ship-building complex for Bayside Shipping which is being given reparations items this year and some electronics factories; but best of all finish the coastal road to Cavite City although we will have to wait for the case pending in the sala of Judge de la Rosa of the Pasay City Court of First Instance; the runway is only 8,000 feet long and therefore cannot be utilized for big planes).<br>
In the afternoon we had the Christmas festival at 3:00 PM for the indigent children. Bongbong delivered the speech for the family party in Tagalog and partly in English – “Ikinagagalak kong pinahintulutan akong umuwi nang aking mga magulang at lumahok sa inyo sa mg araw ng kapaskuhan x xx This Christmas is doubly happy for me — It is the kind of happiness that I intensely wish for everyone — for you, all our people, and our country. × xx Maligayang Pasko at Manigong Bagong Taon sa inyong lahat.”<br>
But again the hysterical explosion of greetings for Bongbong. “Guapo si Bongbong,” was the comment. Of course the girls were more excited than the boys. He received all of these as a matter of fact and casually.<br>
After the induction and dinner of the officers of the Federation of Filipino-Chinese Chambers of Commerce led by Mr. Antonio Roxas Chua at which they pledge cooperation with my administration anew, I met Baby Ysmael at 7:15 PM. He brought an air rifle with tranquilizer darts. I asked Bongbong to come and help me get the gun working. He showed scarce interest and went back as fast as he could to his room to do a recording,<br>
I am amazed at the rapport between him and his sisters. Imee had faithfully written him every event that had happened here and now they seemed to have so much to talk about — classes, the idiosyncrasies of his “mawsters,” the characters in his school, what he thought of the Filipino boys in Worth (Iñigo Zobel who he says is known to be rich but thick [thick headed] and is always copying his homework and the Soriano boys who are on their third year in Worth; he does not think very highly of them). They talk of drama, Shakespeare, Bernard Shaw, Janos Joyce and the other writers.<br>
Imelda and I just listen very fondly – too fondly I am afraid.<br>
But he is more orderly in his habits, takes care of his room which used to be untidy before he went to Worth and seems shy with the girls.<br>
Incidentally all the girls big and small wanted to meet him and shake his hand.<br>
He seems decided not to go to Oxford after Worth but to go to the University of the Philippines instead for his law degree. Apparently he is affected by his classmates who seem to think that Oxford was not much.<br>
And anyway, he says, for him to go to Oxford, he would have to stay six years in Worth.<br>
We are letting him make up his own mind. After all he seems to know what he wants.<br>
